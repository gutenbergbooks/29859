<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dave Porter at Bear Camp</span>" is a complete
story in itself, but forms the eleventh volume in
a line issued under the general title of "Dave
Porter Series."</p>

<p>As I have mentioned several times, this series
was started a number of years ago by the publication
of "Dave Porter at Oak Hall," in which my
young readers were introduced to a typical, wide-awake
American lad at an up-to-date American
boarding school.</p>

<p>The publication of this first volume was followed
by that of "Dave Porter in the South
Seas," whither the lad journeyed to clear up a
question concerning his parentage. Then came
"Dave Porter's Return to School," telling of
more doings at Oak Hall; "Dave Porter in the
Far North," in which he went on a second journey
looking for his father; "Dave Porter and His
Classmates," relating more happenings at school;
"Dave Porter at Star Ranch," in which our hero
participated in many adventures in the wild West;
"Dave Porter and His Rivals," showing how he
outwitted some of his old-time enemies; "Dave
Porter on Cave Island," giving the particulars of
a remarkable voyage on the ocean and strange
doings ashore; "Dave Porter and the Runaways,"
in which the youth taught some of his
chums a much-needed lesson; and finally "Dave
Porter in the Gold Fields," in which the lad and
a number of his chums went in quest of a gold
mine, all traces of which had been lost through a
landslide.</p>

<p>The present volume tells the particulars of a
thrilling rescue from fire at sea, and how the boys
and girls, along with some of the older folks,
went for a vacation in a camp on the shore of a
beautiful lake. Here, most unexpectedly, Dave
fell in with one of his old enemies. The youth
and his chums had some strenuous times, the particulars
of which are given in the pages which
follow.</p>

<p>Once again I avail myself of the opportunity
to thank my young readers for all the pleasant
things they have said regarding my stories. I
trust that the reading of this volume will benefit
them all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h2>THE BOYS ON SHIPBOARD</h2>
<br />

<p>"Phil, your father seems to be a good deal
worried this morning. I hope it isn't on account
of the way we cut up on this ship last evening."</p>

<p>"Not at all, Dave," returned Phil Lawrence.
"I don't believe he noticed our monkey-shines.
He is worried over the letter he received in the
mail we got at our last stopping-place."</p>

<p>"No bad news I hope?" said Roger Morr, another
one of the group of boys seated on the forward
deck of a small coastwise steamer.</p>

<p>"Well, I think it is rather bad news," answered
the son of the vessel's owner. "Poor dad stands
to lose between twenty and thirty thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Twenty or thirty thousand dollars!" exclaimed
Dave Porter. "Why, how can that be,
Phil?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>"Did he make a bad investment?" asked Ben
Basswood, another youth of the group.</p>

<p>"You can hardly call it a bad investment, Ben,"
returned Phil. "Buying the land was all right
enough in the first place. It's trying to get rid of
it that's the sticker."</p>

<p>"You are talking in riddles, Phil," said Roger
Morr. "Won't you explain?"</p>

<p>"Maybe Phil doesn't care to explain," broke in
Dave Porter, quickly. "It may be his father's
private business, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think he'll object to my telling you
the details," responded the shipowner's son. "It
isn't very much of a secret where we live, or in
East Haven."</p>

<p>"East Haven? Is that the place across the
river from where you live?" queried Dave Porter.</p>

<p>"Yes. It's quite a bustling little town, too, although
when my father and his older brother,
Lester Lawrence, bought the tract of land there it
didn't amount to much, and they got the ground
for a song."</p>

<p>"I'd like to buy some land for a song," put in
another youth of the group. "Then I might sell
it and make a handsome profit. Say," he continued,
his face brightening up, "that puts me in
mind of a story. Once there was a man who
wanted to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on, Shadow. It isn't your turn to tell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>stories now," interrupted Dave. "We want to
hear what Phil has to say."</p>

<p>"This story wouldn't take but a minute,"
grumbled Maurice Hamilton, otherwise known as
"Shadow." "It's a dandy one, too."</p>

<p>"All right, we'll listen to it later," returned
Roger Morr. "Let us first hear what Phil has
to tell."</p>

<p>"It isn't so much of a story," said the shipowner's
son. "You see, years ago my dad and
his older brother purchased a tract of land at East
Haven, along the waterfront. For some time it
was idle, and then it was leased to a lumber company,
who used it for a number of years as a lumber
yard. At that time East Haven had no railroad,
but the L. A. &amp; H. line came through
that way and wanted to cross the river at East
Haven, and wanted to locate their railroad repair
shops along the waterfront there. They have
made my father an offer for the land, and if that
tract could be sold my folks would stand to make
a profit of twenty to thirty thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"Well, why not sell the land then&mdash;unless
you think it is worth more than the railroad company
is willing to pay?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"My father is willing enough to sell, and has
been for some time; but he can't give the railroad
a clear title, and consequently the deal is at a standstill."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>"Oh, I see, Phil," said Roger Morr. "That
is the worst of buying land that has a flaw in the
title."</p>

<p>"There wasn't any flaw in the title when my
father and my Uncle Lester purchased the
ground," returned the shipowner's son. And
now his face clouded. "The trouble has all come
up within the last five years&mdash;that is, it wouldn't
have come up at all if it hadn't been for what happened
about five years ago."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think I know to what you refer, Phil,"
cried Dave, quickly. "I remember now that you
told me about your old Uncle Lester. Didn't you
ever hear from him?"</p>

<p>"Not a word, Dave. And that is why my
father can't sell the land."</p>

<p>"I don't understand this," said Ben Basswood.</p>

<p>"And neither do I," added Shadow Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Well, it's this way: About five years ago my
folks were connected with a trust company in the
town where we live. My Uncle Lester was
one of several men who had charge of certain
funds, and these funds were kept in a safe-deposit
vault belonging to the company. One day it was
found that some of these funds had disappeared.
Suspicion pointed to my uncle, and although he
protested his entire innocence, some of the other
trust company officials were in favor of having
him arrested. A warrant was sworn out, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>before it could be served my uncle left home and
went to another State. Then the local paper
came out with an article which stated that the
bank officials had evidence that Lester Lawrence
was undoubtedly guilty. My uncle got a copy of
this paper&mdash;it was found later in the room
he had occupied at a hotel&mdash;and this evidently
frightened him so much that he disappeared."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that he disappeared for
good?" queried Ben.</p>

<p>"Yes, he took a train out of town, and that was
the last seen or heard of him. My father did all
he could to locate Uncle Lester. He had men
searching for him, and he advertised in the newspapers.
But up to the present time he hasn't
heard a word from him or of him. He is half inclined
to believe that my uncle is dead."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he went to some foreign country,"
suggested Dave.</p>

<p>"But how does that affect the title to the land?"
questioned Shadow Hamilton.</p>

<p>"Easily enough," was the reply of the shipowner's
son. "My uncle held a one-quarter interest
in the tract. In order to give a clear title
to the railroad company it would be necessary for
Uncle Lester to sign the deed. The railroad company&mdash;nor
any one else for that matter&mdash;won't
buy the land without a clear title."</p>

<p>"I don't wonder that your father is worried,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>said Dave, sympathetically. "I suppose he feels
just as bad over the continued absence of your
uncle as he does over the fact that he can't sell the
land and make a profit on it."</p>

<p>"That's just it, Dave," answered Phil.
"We'd give a good deal to know what has become
of Uncle Lester."</p>

<p>"I suppose he doesn't dare come back for fear
of being arrested," was Shadow's comment.
"Even if he is innocent they may be able to convict
him."</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot to tell you about that," burst out
Phil. "Less than four months after my uncle
disappeared, some men were arrested in Springfield,
for a theft committed at one of the banks
there. During the trial it came out that one of
these criminals had been in our town during the
time when the funds disappeared from our trust
company. This rascal's movements were traced
by the authorities, and then he was given what they
call 'the third degree.' At that examination he
broke down, and admitted that he had taken the
funds which my Uncle Lester was supposed to
have stolen. The affair created a great stir, and
those who had proceeded against my uncle made
all sorts of apologies to my father. They also
did their best to locate Uncle Lester."</p>

<p>"And didn't they hear anything at all?" asked
Ben.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>"Not a word. We got what we thought were
clues, but every one of them proved false."</p>

<p>"Maybe he is dead."</p>

<p>"That may be. But if we can't prove it, it
leaves the matter of the land just as unsettled as
before."</p>

<p>"If your uncle is alive he must remember about
the land, and must know that the matter will give
your father a lot of trouble," suggested Roger.</p>

<p>"That is true, Roger. But when a man is accused
of a grave crime like that, he isn't apt to
think about other things."</p>

<p>"You say he is older than your father?"
queried Dave.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, a good deal older&mdash;ten or twelve
years, at least. If he is still alive he must be well
advanced in years."</p>

<p>"What does your father propose to do about
the land?" questioned Ben, after a pause in the
conversation.</p>

<p>"He doesn't know what to do. He's at a complete
standstill."</p>

<p>"Won't the railroad company lease the land?"
questioned Dave.</p>

<p>"No. They told dad that they wanted to buy
and build. They prefer his land to any other in
East Haven, but at the same time, if they can't get
his property, they are going to look elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Twenty or thirty thousand dollars is a heap
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>of money to let slip through one's fingers," was
Shadow's comment. "It's a shame you can't find
out where your uncle is, or what has become of
him."</p>

<p>"Why not advertise again?" suggested Dave.
"If your uncle is still alive he must read some
newspapers, and he might possibly see the notice."</p>

<p>"Father thinks something of doing that, Dave,
but it looks like rather a hopeless case," returned
Phil Lawrence. He arose from the camp-chair on
which he had been sitting, and stretched himself.
"But come on, fellows," he continued. "There
is no use of your worrying over our troubles. We
came on this little trip to enjoy ourselves, and I
want all of you to have the best time possible."</p>

<p>"And we certainly have had a good time!"
cried Dave. "Just as good a time as we had out
in Yellowstone Park."</p>

<p>"That is, Dave, considering the girls are not
along," remarked Ben, with a wink at the others.</p>

<p>"Well, of course that makes some difference,
Ben," returned Dave, his face flushing a trifle.</p>

<p>"Sure it does! A whole lot of difference!"
declared Roger. "Just the same, we are having
a dandy time, Phil," he added hastily. "The first
outing of the Oak Hall Club is a big success."</p>

<p>"It sure is!" broke in Shadow Hamilton.
"Only I did hope we'd see a whale or some sharks
or something like that," he added, regretfully.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>"I suppose if you saw a shark, Shadow, you'd
jump right overboard to interview him, wouldn't
you?" queried Ben, and gave a snicker.</p>

<p>"Say, speaking of sharks puts me in mind of a
story!" cried Shadow. "Once there was a sailor
who had traveled all around the world. He met
a lady in Boston who wanted him to tell her a
shark story. Says the sailor: 'Madam, I've
seen sharks in the Atlantic an' the Pacific an' the
Indian Oceans, but all of them sharks wasn't a
patch to the shark I once met on land.' 'On
land!' cried the lady from Boston. 'Do you
mean to say that you met a shark on land?' 'I
did, Madam,' answered the sailor. 'I met a
shark right in New York, and he did me out of
every copper I had in my pockets. He was a
hotel-keeper who played cards.'" And at this
little yarn there was a general smile.</p>

<p>"Pretty good for a fish story," was Roger's
comment. "Just the same, I don't want to fall
in with any sharks whether on land or at sea."</p>

<p>"Before we land to-night, I want to settle about
this outing we expect to take at Mirror Lake,"
said Dave. "If you fellows are going along,
we'll have to make the necessary arrangements."</p>

<p>"Well, you can count on me, Dave," returned
Roger, promptly. "I told you at the start that
I'd be glad to go with you."</p>

<p>"And so will I be glad to go," added Phil.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>"I've got to find out what my folks want me to
do first," said Shadow. He looked curiously at
Dave, who was gazing far out to sea. "What are
you looking at, Dave?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'm watching that smoke out there," was the
answer.</p>

<p>"That's only the smoke from some incoming
steamer," returned Ben. "I noticed that a few
minutes ago."</p>

<p>"Maybe it is from a steamer," returned Dave,
"but I don't think it is coming from any funnel."</p>

<p>"What do you think it is&mdash;a fire?" cried
Phil. And at these words all the boys on the deck
rushed to the rail.</p>

<p>"It looks that way to me. Let us get the
glasses and find out."</p>

<p>"I'll get them!" cried Roger; and lost no time
in disappearing into the cabin.</p>

<p>A minute later he reappeared with a pair of
powerful marine glasses which he handed to Phil.
The glasses were quickly adjusted, and the shipowner's
son took a hasty look seaward.</p>

<p>"It's a small steamer, all right," he announced.
"Just as sure as you're born, there's a fire on
board."</p>

<p>"Fire!" repeated Roger.</p>

<p>"If she's on fire we ought to go to the rescue!"
exclaimed Dave.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h2>SOMETHING ABOUT THE PAST</h2>
<br />

<p>"What's this I hear about fire?"</p>

<p>The question came from a burly, pleasant-faced
man, who had just appeared on deck, close to the
boys. It was Mr. Lawrence, the owner of the
steamer.</p>

<p>"Why, Dad, there's a steamer out there, and
we think she's on fire," answered Phil, quickly.
"Here, take a look at her." And he handed over
the marine glasses.</p>

<p>"On fire!" exclaimed Mr. Lawrence, and
raised the glasses to his eyes. "By Jove, boys, I
think you're right! Phil, call Captain Bradley,
and be quick about it. You'll find him in the
after cabin. I just left him there."</p>

<p>The son darted off, and while he was gone Mr.
Lawrence and the boys took turns in looking
through the glasses at the distant vessel. The
smoke was now increasing, and as it did not come
from the funnel of the steamer, there was no doubt
but that the vessel was on fire.</p>

<p>"You sent for me, Mr. Lawrence?" inquired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>the captain of the steamer, as he hurried up with
Phil at his heels.</p>

<p>"Yes, Captain. There's another steamer out
there, and we are pretty sure she's on fire," answered
Mr. Lawrence. "Change your course
and put on speed." And as he spoke the shipowner
turned the glasses over to the captain.</p>

<p>Captain Bradley gave one searching look.
"It's true! She's on fire, and we had better get
to her as soon as possible!" he cried, and then
hurried away to give the necessary directions.
Soon the bow of the <i>Eaglet</i>, which was the name
of the steamer, was headed in the direction of the
craft that seemed to be in trouble.</p>

<p>"If she's really in danger, I hope we get there
soon enough to help those on board," said Dave.</p>

<p>"Captain Bradley will do his best; you can rely
on that," answered Mr. Lawrence, gravely.
"But that steamer is farther off than some of you
may imagine. Distances over the water are rather
deceptive."</p>

<p>Many of my young readers are doubtless already
well acquainted with Dave Porter. For
the benefit of those who are now meeting the youth
for the first time, something of an introduction
may not be out of place.</p>

<p>When but a child of tender age, our hero had
been found one day walking along the railroad
tracks near the town of Crumville. He could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>tell nothing about himself or where he belonged,
and was taken to the local poorhouse, where he remained
for a number of years, finally being bound
out to a retired college professor, named Caspar
Potts, who was then running a small farm for his
health. The professor did what he could for the
lad, giving him a fairly good education. But Professor
Potts was no farmer and soon got into financial
difficulties with a mean money-lender, named
Aaron Poole, and would have lost his farm had
it not been for something out of the ordinary happening.</p>

<p>One of the main industries of Crumville was a
large jewelry factory, owned by Mr. Oliver Wadsworth.
Mr. Wadsworth had a beautiful young
daughter, named Jessie, and one day through an
explosion of an automobile gasoline tank, the
young miss was in danger of being burned to death
when Dave came to her rescue. This so pleased
the Wadsworths that they came not only to the aid
of the boy, but also assisted Caspar Potts, who
was discovered to be one of Mr. Wadsworth's
former instructors at college.</p>

<p>"The lad shall go to boarding-school and get
a good education," said Oliver Wadsworth. And
he accordingly sent Dave away from home, as related
in the first book of this series, entitled "Dave
Porter at Oak Hall." At that school our hero
made many warm friends, including Phil <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>Lawrence,
the son of a wealthy shipowner; Roger
Morr, the offspring of a United States senator;
Shadow Hamilton, who was known far and wide
for his yarn-spinning qualities; and many others.</p>

<p>In those days the great cloud resting over Dave
had been the question of his identity, and when
some of his enemies spoke of him as "that poorhouse
nobody," he resolved to find out who he
really was. Getting a strange clue, he set out on a
remarkable ocean voyage, as related in "Dave
Porter in the South Seas," and was gratified to fall
in with his uncle, Dunston Porter, a great hunter
and traveler. Then the lad came back to Oak
Hall, as related in "Dave Porter's Return to
School." He next went in quest of his father, as
told in "Dave Porter in the Far North."</p>

<p>"Now they can't say that I'm a 'poorhouse nobody,'"
he told his chums, after having met his
father. And then, with a light heart, he came
back to boarding-school once again, as related in
"Dave Porter and His Classmates." Here he
made more friends than ever, but likewise some bitter
enemies, including one Link Merwell, the son
of a ranch-owner of the West. Merwell did all
he could to cause Dave trouble, but in the end was
exposed and had to leave Oak Hall.</p>

<p>"I hope I never fall in with Link Merwell
again," Dave said to his school chums, but this was
not to be. Dave had not only found his father
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>and an uncle, but he had also found a sister, Laura
Porter, who was very dear to him. Laura had a
young lady friend, named Belle Endicott, who
lived in the Far West, and through this friend
Dave and his chums, and also Laura, as well as
Jessie Wadsworth, received an invitation to spend
some time at the Endicott place. They had a
great deal of fun and not a few adventures, all of
which have been set down in "Dave Porter at Star
Ranch." Not far from the Endicott place was
the home of Link Merwell, and that young man,
as before, tried to make trouble, but his efforts
were frustrated and he left home under a cloud.</p>

<p>From the ranch Dave and his chums returned
again to Oak Hall, as recorded in "Dave Porter
and His Rivals." Then came the Christmas Holidays,
and Dave went back to Crumville, where he
and his folks were now living with the Wadsworth
family in their elegant mansion on the outskirts of
the town. Directly after Christmas there was a
thrilling jewelry robbery at Mr. Wadsworth's
factory. It was Dave, aided by some of his
chums, who got on the track of the robbers and
trailed them to the South and then to sea, as related
in "Dave Porter on Cave Island."</p>

<p>When our hero and his chums went back to Oak
Hall they imagined that their adventures were at
an end. But soon came in news of a strange man
who was terrorizing the neighborhood. Some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>very unusual things happened, including an attempt
to blow up a neighboring hotel. Some of the
students were thought guilty, and fearing arrest,
they fled in terror, as told of in "Dave Porter and
the Runaways." Dave was not one of those who
ran away, but he did go after the others, and made
them come back to face the music, and also helped
to clear up what had been a great mystery. Then
all the boys graduated from Oak Hall, Dave receiving
high honors.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that our hero at that time
was one of the happiest boys in the world. His
folks and Jessie Wadsworth came to the graduation,
which was celebrated with big bonfires, music
by a band, and refreshments in the gymnasium.</p>

<p>Dave had promised Roger Morr that he would
pay the Senator's son a visit. He did so, along
with Phil and some others, and on that occasion
heard about a gold mine which had been willed to
Mrs. Morr, and which had been completely swallowed
up by a landslide. Numerous searches had
been made for this lost mine, but up to that time
without result.</p>

<p>"Let us go in search of the lost mine," Dave
had said. And how he and Roger and some of
the others made the trip to the West and went
on a hunt for the mine has been told in detail in
the volume entitled "Dave Porter in the Gold
Fields."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>While the lads were on this quest, they again
fell in with Link Merwell, who with Job Haskers,
a former teacher at Oak Hall, was also trying to
locate the lost mine. The two parties had many
adventures, and when at last the missing mine was
relocated, there came another landslide which
nearly cost Dave and his friends their lives.
When they finally reached a place of safety they
were joined by a man from the other party who
had suffered severely, and who told them that
Link Merwell and Job Haskers, as well as a third
person of the party, had been swept away to their
death. Later on Dave and his friends had looked
for the missing persons, but had been unable to
locate them.</p>

<p>The finding of the Landslide Mine, as it was
called, had been of great financial benefit to the
Morr family, and they had been so pleased that
they had given Dave and some of the others a
share in the holding. In the meanwhile our hero
and his chums, along with their friends, had
finished their outing in the West by a grand tour
through Yellowstone Park, on which they were accompanied
by Dave's sister, Jessie and Belle, and
some others.</p>

<p>"Now you fellows have got to come on a little
trip with me," Phil had said, after coming East,
and had explained that a small steamer belonging
to his father was then tied up at Philadelphia, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>getting
ready for a trip to Portland, Maine, and
back.</p>

<p>"That will be fine," Dave had answered; and a
little later a party had been made up, including
Phil, Dave, Roger, and Shadow, and also Ben
Basswood, who, as my old readers know, was one
of Dave's old friends from Crumville. With the
boys went Mr. Lawrence. When embarking on
this trip, none of those on board had dreamed of
the strenuous time now so close at hand.</p>

<p>"I wonder how long it will take us to reach that
vessel?" observed Roger, after Mr. Lawrence
had followed the captain.</p>

<p>"A quarter of an hour at least," replied Dave.
"It will depend somewhat on how much steam the
firemen can get up. I don't believe we are running
at full speed now."</p>

<p>"This steamer used to be a pretty good boat,"
said Phil, "but she is getting old now, and I heard
dad say something about laying her up for repairs
next Fall."</p>

<p>"Wonder if we'll get a chance to do any rescue
work," observed Ben.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll do all we can," returned Shadow.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" cried Dave, pointing with
his hand. "The smoke is getting thicker than
ever!"</p>

<p>"Maybe the poor people on that steamer will
have to jump overboard before we can reach
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>them," said Phil. "A fire like that must be pretty
hot."</p>

<p>Soon the youths knew by the pounding of the
engine that the <i>Eaglet</i> was running at increased
speed. The course had been changed, and now
the craft was headed directly for the burning boat.</p>

<p>"She's a rather small affair, that's certain," remarked
Roger.</p>

<p>"Looks to me as if she might be a pleasure
boat," remarked Phil, who, taking after his father,
knew considerable about sea-going matters.
"She's a private steam yacht, to my way of thinking."
And later on this proved to be the case.</p>

<p>As the <i>Eaglet</i> drew closer to the burning vessel,
the boys saw that there was great excitement on
board the steam yacht. Sailors and others were
rushing to and fro over the deck, and two streams
of water from hoses were being directed to one
part of the vessel, down a hatchway. The smoke
was as thick as ever, and sometimes, as the wind
shifted, the steam yacht was hidden entirely from
view.</p>

<p>Fortunately the sea was comparatively calm,
there being only a slight breeze from the northeast.
As the <i>Eaglet</i> drew closer, the boys heard
Captain Bradley giving directions to some of the
sailors to get ready to launch two of the small
boats.</p>

<p>"Dad, why can't we take another small boat and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>go out?" asked Phil of his father. "We know
how to row. We did lots of it on the river up at
Oak Hall."</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Mr. Lawrence. "But
I want all of you to keep out of danger."</p>

<p>Soon they were within hailing distance of the
steam yacht. They could now see the persons on
deck plainly, and made out fully a score of men,
and three or four women, and also one or two
children. The smoke was as thick as ever, but so
far no flames were visible.</p>

<p>"Save us, oh, save us!" screamed some one
aboard the burning vessel. "We are burning
up!"</p>

<p>The words had scarcely been uttered when there
came from the interior of the steam yacht a dull explosion.
Then, of a sudden, something that
looked like a bunch of rockets flew up into the air.
With a loud hissing and with sparks flying in all
directions, the bunch of rockets described a graceful
curve and then headed directly for the deck of
the <i>Eaglet</i>!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h2>THE RESCUE AT SEA</h2>
<br />

<p>"Look out there!"</p>

<p>"Don't let those rockets hit you!"</p>

<p>"Say, this is like a Fourth of July!"</p>

<p>Such were some of the cries that came from the
boys on the forward deck of the steamer when
they saw the bunch of rockets flying swiftly toward
them. They had barely time to leap to one
side when, with a loud hissing, two of the rockets
fell on the deck not far away. The others just
grazed the rail and swept overboard.</p>

<p>"We've got to put them out!" yelled Phil, and
started to rush forward, intending to stamp on the
rockets, when Dave hauled him back.</p>

<p>"Look out, Phil! They may be on the point
of explo&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bang! Bang! Dave did not have time
to finish what he was saying when the rockets went
off in rapid succession, hurling the bits of fire in all
directions. Phil was burnt a little on one cheek,
and Dave and Roger each had a hand scorched, but
that was all. Then, realizing that the worst was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>over, all the boys rushed forward and stamped out
what was left of the flames.</p>

<p>"Anybody hurt up there?" It was a cry from
Captain Bradley, who came forward on a run, followed
by Mr. Lawrence.</p>

<p>"No. We're all right," gasped Phil. "But
we might not be if it hadn't been for Dave;" and
he gave our hero a grateful look.</p>

<p>The explosion on the steam yacht had caused a
wilder panic than ever, and in a twinkling a number
of those on board leaped into the water.</p>

<p>"Man the boats!" was the order from Captain
Bradley.</p>

<p>The <i>Eaglet</i> had already heaved to, and two rowboats
manned by the sailors and commanded by the
first mate and a boatswain were soon lowered to
the water. While this was being done, the boys,
led by Phil and Dave, rushed to a third rowboat.</p>

<p>"Now be careful, boys," warned Mr. Lawrence.
"Perhaps I had better go with you."</p>

<p>"Just as you say, Dad," answered Phil. "We
can take care of ourselves though."</p>

<p>"All right then, I won't go, for you may want
the room for those you pick up," answered the
shipowner; and a moment later the rowboat was
in the water and following the other small craft to
the side of the burning vessel.</p>

<p>Seeing those from the <i>Eaglet</i> coming to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>rescue, several others leaped overboard, so that
those in the rowboats had all they could do to move
without hitting any one.</p>

<p>"Save me! Save me! Don't let me drown!"
yelled an elderly man, and caught hold of one of
the oars.</p>

<p>"All right, we'll save you. Take it easy," returned
the first mate of the <i>Eaglet</i>; and soon those
in the mate's rowboat had the man on board. In
the meantime, the boat in command of the boatswain
pulled in a woman and a little boy.</p>

<p>Dave and his chums had their craft headed to
where they had made out the forms of a woman
and a girl struggling in the water. They soon
reached the first of the pair, and after considerable
difficulty managed to drag her on board.</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, thank you!" gasped the
woman, as she sank down on the stern seat.
"Now save Della! save Della!" she cried, and
then suddenly collapsed.</p>

<p>Dave had his eyes on the girl, and was on the
point of reaching for her when she suddenly threw
up her arms and disappeared.</p>

<p>"She's gone under!" gasped Roger.</p>

<p>"Will she come up again?" asked Shadow, anxiously.</p>

<p>"There she is! Over there!" yelled Phil, and
pointed to a spot several yards away.</p>

<p>A hand and an arm had shown themselves, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>that was all. In less than two seconds they disappeared
again.</p>

<p>Dave had done some rapid thinking. Before
leaving the steamer the boys had thrown off their
coats. Now standing up, Dave cast his cap to the
bottom of the boat, and made a quick dive overboard.</p>

<p>"He's gone after her!"</p>

<p>"Good for Dave! It's the only thing to do if
that girl is to be saved."</p>

<p>"Row on and keep your eyes wide open," directed
Phil. "I don't think they'll get very far
away."</p>

<p>Dave had calculated the distance as closely as
possible, and once under water he pushed ahead
with all speed in the direction where he had seen
the hand and arm. While at Oak Hall he had
learned the trick of swimming under water with
his eyes open, and this now stood him in good
stead.</p>

<p>"There she is," he thought, as he caught sight
of something white passing just to the left of him.
He made a quick turn, and a few seconds later had
the girl by the hand. Then Dave caught her under
the arms, and treading water, brought both
her and himself to the surface.</p>

<p>"There they are!" he heard Phil cry, and the
next moment the rowboat came up close.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! sa&mdash;sa&mdash;save m&mdash;me!" spluttered
the girl; and breaking loose, she swung
around and caught Dave tightly by the neck.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>It was the strangle-hold of a drowning person,
and our hero might have fared badly had not assistance
been at hand. But as it was, Roger and
Phil reached out, and while Shadow and Ben balanced
the rowboat, this pair hauled the girl on
board. Then they aided Dave in getting in.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh! Is sh&mdash;she d&mdash;dead?" gasped
the girl, as she looked at the woman who had collapsed
on the stern seat.</p>

<p>"No, she has only fainted," answered Roger.
"She'll soon be over it."</p>

<p>"How brave you are to come to our rescue!"
went on the girl, turning to Dave. "I&mdash;I
thought I was going to drown!" and she shuddered.</p>

<p>"It was a pretty close call," answered Phil.
"My friend here jumped overboard just in the
nick of time."</p>

<p>There was just then little time to say more, for
others were in the water crying for assistance. In
the meantime, there was another cry from the deck
of the steam yacht.</p>

<p>"Don't jump overboard! It isn't necessary.
The fire is out!"</p>

<p>"Hello! Did you hear that?" queried Dave.
"Somebody said the fire is out."</p>

<p>By this time the two other rowboats had picked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>up eight of those who had leaped overboard.
The boys succeeded in getting on board two others,
a short, fat man who was puffing like a porpoise,
and a young man.</p>

<p>"That settles it," snorted the fat man, as he
sank down on one of the seats. "No more ocean
pictures for me! All the dramas I act in after
this will be on dry land."</p>

<p>"And I sha'n't go to sea again for Mr. Appleby,"
answered the girl who had been rescued.
She was rapidly recovering, and so was the woman
on the stern seat.</p>

<p>"Got everybody?" yelled a man from the deck
of the steam yacht. And by his cap and uniform
the boys knew he must be the captain of the vessel.</p>

<p>"I think so," answered the first mate of the
<i>Eaglet</i>.</p>

<p>"It was foolish of them to jump overboard,"
grumbled the captain of the steam yacht. "I told
all of them there was no danger."</p>

<p>"No danger!" snorted the mate of the <i>Eaglet</i>.
"How do you make that out, with all that fire?"</p>

<p>"It wasn't fire&mdash;that is, not much of it,"
was the answer. "It was mostly smoke. We
have a moving picture company on board, and they
had a lot of fireworks, some of 'em tied up in old
sail cloth. The fireworks started to go off&mdash;why
I don't know&mdash;and they set fire to the
cloth, and when we wet that down it made an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>awful smoke. But all the stuff was in a zinc-lined
compartment, so there wasn't much real danger.
The worst was when those rockets went off and
shot up right out of the hatchway."</p>

<p>"And are you sure the fire is entirely out?"
asked the mate of Mr. Lawrence's vessel.</p>

<p>"Just about. We'll have the men make a
search, so that there won't be any further danger."</p>

<p>After a little more conversation the three rowboats
were brought close to the steam yacht, from
the side of which a ladder had been lowered.</p>

<p>"O dear! Are we to go back to that boat?"
queried the girl Dave had saved from drowning.</p>

<p>She was a miss of perhaps eighteen years, tall
and slender, with brown hair and big brown eyes.
She appealed to our hero as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I don't see what else there is to do," he answered,
"unless you want to be taken to our
steamer."</p>

<p>"What place is your steamer bound for?"</p>

<p>"We hope to make Portland some time this
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Oh indeed! Then I think I would rather go
aboard that steamer than back on the yacht," answered
the young lady. "What do you think,
Aunt Bess?" she went on, appealing to the woman
in the rowboat, who by this time had recovered
from her plunge into the sea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>"I think I would like to get ashore as soon as
possible, Della," returned the aunt. "I just hate
the water, anyway, and I don't think I'll take another
sea trip in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Oh, say, Miss Ford, you might as well go back
on the steam yacht. I guess the danger is all
over," put in the fourth person who had been
picked up&mdash;a young man about Dave's age.
"Didn't you hear the captain say that the fire was
out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," answered Della Ford. "But
I'm so afraid, Mr. Porton," and the girl looked
rather helplessly at those around her.</p>

<p>"Where is that steam yacht bound for?" questioned
Phil.</p>

<p>"We were going somewhere outside of Cape
Cod," answered the stout man who had been
rescued. "But I guess Mr. Appleby will have to
give the trip up for the present. He's the manager
of our company, you know," he added, by
way of explanation.</p>

<p>"What sort of a company is that&mdash;a
theatrical company?" asked Shadow.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. This is a moving-picture company&mdash;one
belonging to the Appleby Film Corporation."</p>

<p>"Oh, then you are all moving-picture actors!"
cried Ben, with interest.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the young man. "But we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>didn't come out to get into any such scene as this,"
he added, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>By this time a number of those in the rowboats
had been assisted to the deck of the steam yacht,
and those above were calling down to those in the
rowboat manned by Dave and his chums.</p>

<p>"Say, young men, I'm very much obliged to you
for what you did for me," cried the stout man,
heartily, as he prepared to ascend the ladder. "I
guess I was foolish to jump overboard when there
was no great danger."</p>

<p>"It's too bad Case didn't get a picture of that
scene," said the young man named Porton. "It
would have been a dandy to work into one of the
sea dramas."</p>

<p>"I guess that's right," returned Dave, with a
grim smile.</p>

<p>"Much obliged to all of you," went on Ward
Porton. "If there are any charges, send the bill
to Mr. Thomas Appleby, the manager. He
ought to reward you handsomely for saving a part
of his company." And with these words he followed
the stout man to the deck of the steam
yacht.</p>

<p>"Aren't you folks coming up?" came a call
from the manager of the moving-picture company,
as he leaned over the rail.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Appleby, I don't want to stay out
here!" cried Della Ford, "and neither does my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>Aunt Bess! The young men here say their boat is
going to Portland. Maybe we had better go there
and take the train to Boston."</p>

<p>"Oh, there is no use in doing that, Miss Ford,"
answered the manager. "The fire is out, and it
is perfectly safe on board now. You had better
come up here. I will help you," and he reached
down with his hand.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose it will be just the right thing to
do, to desert the company," said Mrs. Ford, the
girl's aunt. "We still have to act in several
scenes on the ship, you must remember."</p>

<p>"Very well, Aunty, just as you say," returned
the girl. "But oh! I must thank this young man
for what he did for me!" she went on. And at
the danger of causing the rowboat to tip, she bent
over and caught Dave's hand in both of her own.
"Won't you please tell me your name?"</p>

<p>"It's Dave Porter," was the answer. "Come,
let me help you up the ladder."</p>

<p>"My name is Della Ford, and I belong in
Boston. You are a very brave young man, and I
shall never forget you. Some time when you are
in Boston you must come to see me."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Ford, perhaps I will," answered
Dave. And after a word or two more, he
assisted the young lady up the ladder. Then the
boys helped Mrs. Ford, who was still so weak that
she could hardly stand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>The first mate of the <i>Eaglet</i> was on the deck of
the steam yacht, talking to the captain. In the
meantime several sailors were at work putting out
the last sparks of the fire. Quite a quantity of
fireworks had gone off, and the burnt portions were
thrown overboard. The moving-picture manager
explained that the fireworks had been brought
along to be used in one of the film dramas.</p>

<p>"Might as well get back to the steamer," suggested
Roger, after several minutes had passed,
during which time the boys had been calling to
those on the deck of the steam yacht. "We can't
do anything more here."</p>

<p>"All right," returned Phil, and gave orders to
pull away.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Mr. Porter!" called out Della
Ford, waving her hand. "Thank you ever so
much for what you did. And don't forget to call
and see me when you come to Boston."</p>

<p>"Good-bye," returned Dave; and a moment
later the rowboat shot out of hearing and was
headed toward the <i>Eaglet</i>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h2>BACK TO CRUMVILLE</h2>
<br />

<p>"I think those on board that steam yacht can
congratulate themselves because the fire was no
worse," remarked Roger, when the boys had returned
to the <i>Eaglet</i>.</p>

<p>"Yes indeed," answered Dave. "Some fires
at sea are terrible things, and cause a great loss
of life."</p>

<p>"Seems to me Dave was the hero of the occasion!"
burst out Ben. "He did the really-and-truly
rescue act."</p>

<p>"Come now, don't start anything like that!"
interrupted Dave, hastily. "I only did what any
of you might have done."</p>

<p>"I know one thing," remarked Phil, closing one
eye suggestively. "Dave made some hit with the
young lady he pulled out of the water."</p>

<p>"That's right!" agreed Shadow. "Why, do
you know I thought Miss Ford was going to throw
her arms right around his neck."</p>

<p>"Oh, cut it! cut it!" said Dave, growing red
in the face. "Shadow, your imagination will be
the death of you."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>"Oh, I don't know," replied the former story-teller
of Oak Hall, coolly. "She certainly was
smitten, Dave."</p>

<p>"Not at all. She was grateful, that's all."</p>

<p>"Just the same, Dave, if we get to Boston
you'll have to call on her," remarked Roger, with
a grin.</p>

<p>"We can all call if you feel that way about
it," answered our hero. "I rather think some
of you were smitten pretty badly." And at this
sally there was a general laugh.</p>

<p>It was some time before the last of the rowboats
returned to the steamer. The first mate
brought a report to Captain Bradley and Mr.
Lawrence, to which the boys listened with interest.
The mate said that it was thought on board the
steam yacht that the fire had started from a cigarette
thrown away by one of the moving-picture
actors, a young man named Ward Porton, but
that this could not be proved. The mate stated
that the captain of the steam yacht was quite upset
over the occurrence, as he considered that the
fire was due to carelessness, and nothing else.
He had told the mate privately that it would be
a long time before he would take out another
moving-picture company on his vessel.</p>

<p>"He says they are doing all sorts of stunts on
the ship, and taking pictures of 'em," went on the
mate. "He says some of the actors and actresses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>are pretty good people, but the rest of the bunch
act like wild Indians."</p>

<p>"Ward Porton!" exclaimed Dave, turning to
his chums. "Why, that is the young fellow we
hauled out of the water!"</p>

<p>"That's right," returned Phil. "Maybe he
got scared when he found out that his cigarette
had started the fire and that was one reason why
he jumped overboard."</p>

<p>"I didn't like the manner of that fellow at all,"
was Shadow's comment. "He looked like a
pretty loose sort of a character."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. I thought he looked
like&mdash;&mdash;" began Ben, and then stopped suddenly,
in some confusion.</p>

<p>"Looked like what, Ben?" asked Dave, curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't matter, Dave," answered his
Crumville chum. "Just the same, I can't help
but think that&mdash;Oh well, never mind, let it go."</p>

<p>"But what did you think he looked like, Ben?"
put in Phil. "Come, what are you so mysterious
about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't matter, I tell you," answered
Ben, and now looked more confused than ever.</p>

<p>"Hello! Ben is trying to hide some deep and
dark mystery," put in Shadow. "Come now,
little boy, unlimber your mind and let us know
what it is."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>"Well; if you've got to know, I'll tell you. I
was thinking that in some way that Ward Porton
looked something like Dave."</p>

<p>"Say, that's right!" burst out Phil, and then
added quickly to our hero: "No offense, old
man, but he did resemble you&mdash;only of course
he was not so good-looking."</p>

<p>"Yes, there was some resemblance," said
Roger, "but I don't think it was enough to count;
so Dave needn't worry."</p>

<p>"I guess Mr. Ward Porton has a perfect right
to his looks," remarked Dave calmly. "And if
he and I resemble each other, that is nobody's
fault. I don't suppose I'll ever see that fellow
again." But in this surmise our hero was very
much mistaken; in the weeks to come he was to
see a great deal of Ward Porton.</p>

<p>It was not long after this when the <i>Eaglet</i> resumed
her run for Portland. As the other vessel
was headed in the opposite direction, they soon
passed out of sight of the craft. Then Portland
Light came into view, and before long the <i>Eaglet</i>
was passing the numerous islands of Casco
Bay.</p>

<p>"This would be a dandy place to pass the rest
of the summer," was Roger's comment, as he and
Dave stood by the rail, watching the beautiful
scene as it was unfolded before them. The bay
was very calm, and the numerous islands dotting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>it in all directions made the spot one of unsurpassed
beauty.</p>

<p>"From all accounts, Roger, I think we'll find
the vicinity of Mirror Lake just as beautiful as
this," answered Dave. "I have never been
there, but they tell me the scenery is simply
grand."</p>

<p>"We certainly ought to have a good time,
scenery or no scenery," answered the senator's
son, "with such a fine bunch of people as are
going."</p>

<p>"Right you are!" broke in Phil. "We ought
to have the best times ever at the lake."</p>

<p>It had been arranged by Mr. Lawrence that
they should stop for three days at Portland, the
owner of the steamer having a number of business
matters to transact. During that time the boys
continued to sleep on board, but spent the days
in visiting Old Orchard Beach, Cape Elizabeth,
Peak's Island, Orr's Island, and various other
nearby resorts.</p>

<p>"It certainly is a great place," remarked Dave,
on the evening of the second day. "I think a
fellow could spend his whole summer here, and
have a dandy time."</p>

<p>It had been a question whether they would stop
at Boston on the return trip, but at the last minute
Mr. Lawrence decided to go direct to New York
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>City, as he had been informed that a cargo was
waiting there for the steamer.</p>

<p>"That cuts Dave out of his visit to Miss
Ford," remarked Roger, after this announcement
was made.</p>

<p>"I think it cuts you out just as much as it does
me, Roger," returned our hero, with a smile. "I
think, behind it all, you would like first-rate to
call on her."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I would like," answered the
senator's son. "I'd like to see how they take
moving pictures&mdash;I mean the kind indoors."</p>

<p>"We may get a chance at that some day," said
Phil. "I know one or two men who are in that
business."</p>

<p>The run to New York City occurred without
special incident, and soon the boys found themselves
saying good-bye to Mr. Lawrence and
Captain Bradley. It had been decided that Phil
should accompany Dave and Ben to Crumville, he
to remain with our hero at the Wadsworth mansion.</p>

<p>"Take care of my boy," said the shipowner,
as he shook hands with Dave.</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll take care of him, Mr. Lawrence,
don't fear," answered our hero. And then, leaving
Mr. Lawrence to look after matters concerning
his various vessels, the boys hurried to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>Grand Central Terminal, and were soon on a
train which was to take them to their various
destinations.</p>

<p>As my old readers know, Crumville was rather
a small town; the only industry of importance
being Mr. Wadsworth's jewelry works. The
Wadsworth mansion stood on the outskirts, a
large and well-constructed building, set among a
number of trees and bushes. When Dave, Phil,
and Ben alighted at the railroad depot, they
found the Wadsworth touring-car awaiting them.
Dunston Porter, Dave's uncle, was driving the
car, and he had with him Dave's sister Laura, and
Jessie Wadsworth.</p>

<p>"Oh, here they are!" cried Laura, and leaped
out to embrace her brother and to shake hands
with the others. Then Jessie shook hands, giving
Dave an extra bright smile as she did so.</p>

<p>"Back from the salt, salt sea!" cried Laura,
merrily. "I'll wager you were all dreadfully
seasick."</p>

<p>"Nothing doing on that score, Laura," answered
her brother. "We didn't have time to
get seasick; we had too much fun."</p>

<p>"And too many adventures," added Phil.
"Oh, I can tell you, girls, we are heroes!" and
he stuck his thumbs in the armholes of his vest,
and began to strut around.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>"Adventures, eh?" queried Dunston Porter.
"What sort of adventures&mdash;a shipwreck?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Porter, please don't talk about a
shipwreck!" pleaded Jessie, agitatedly. "Why,
you don't want anybody to be drowned, do you?"</p>

<p>"They don't look very much as if they had
been in a shipwreck," responded Dave's uncle,
dryly. "I was only fooling."</p>

<p>"We weren't in any shipwreck. But we saw
a fire at sea, and we helped to pull some folks
out of the water," said Ben.</p>

<p>"You did!" burst from both of the girls.</p>

<p>"Do tell us all about it," added Laura.</p>

<p>"Was anybody lost?" asked Jessie. And now
even Dunston Porter looked much interested.</p>

<p>"Nobody was lost, and not even hurt, so far
as I could find out," answered Dave; and then he
and the others gave a few details concerning the
conflagration aboard the steam yacht.</p>

<p>"And to think those poor people had to jump
overboard!" came from Jessie, sympathetically.
"Oh, Dave, wasn't that dreadful!"</p>

<p>"Jessie, you ought to have seen Dave playing
the really-and-truly hero act!" burst out Ben.</p>

<p>"Now, Ben, quit it!" interrupted Dave.</p>

<p>"Not much, Dave! You deserve some credit,
and I want the girls to know what a real, genuine,
dyed-in-the-wool hero you are."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>"What did he do, Ben?" asked Laura.</p>

<p>"He jumped into the briny deep, and rescued
the beautiful heroine of the moving-picture company,"
was the answer. "Oh, you just ought to
have seen it, Jessie. The poor girl was going
down for the last time when Dave, with a do-or-die
look on his handsome face, leaped into the
flying spume, and struck out boldly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ben, will you please stop?" pleaded Dave.
"I never heard such foolish talk before in my
life!"</p>

<p>"But he did jump overboard, and he did save
the girl," broke in Phil. "If he hadn't gone
after her she might have drowned."</p>

<p>"Who was she?" asked Laura; while Jessie,
wide-eyed, showed her interest.</p>

<p>"The leading lady of the film company&mdash;a
Miss Della Ford," answered the shipowner's son.
"A mighty nice young lady, too&mdash;real stylish&mdash;golden-brown
hair, dreamy brown eyes, and all
that sort of thing, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, that was splendid of you to save
her from drowning!" said Jessie.</p>

<p>"Indeed it was!" added Ben. "And she was
mighty grateful, too," he went on. "She
grabbed Dave's hands for all she was worth, and,
at one time, I thought she was going to throw
her arms right around his neck."</p>

<p>"Oh, Ben!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>"Well, it seemed that way to me, anyway&mdash;and
she was a stunning looking girl, too, I can tell
you!"</p>

<p>"She was not going to do anything of the kind,
Jessie! Don't pay any attention to him," broke
in Dave, and now his face was decidedly red.
"Come on! Let's get into the auto and get to
the house; I'm hungry," and he started to help
the two girls into the tonneau of the automobile.</p>

<p>"We'll have to hear more of this later on,"
said Dunston Porter, as he started the car.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'd like to hear more about Miss Ford,"
added Jessie, in a somewhat uncertain tone.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h2>DAVE AT HOME</h2>
<br />

<p>Mirror Lake was a beautiful sheet of water
nestling among the mountains of the Upper Adirondacks
of New York State. At the lower end
of the lake, where there was a well-defined trail
running to several fashionable summer resorts
some miles away, were located two beautiful
bungalows, one of six rooms and the other of
eight rooms. They were built on a plot of
ground bordering on a small cove of the lake, and
extending about a thousand feet back into the
woods of the mountain-side.</p>

<p>As my old readers will remember, Ben Basswood's
father was interested in real estate, and,
a year or two before, he and Mr. Wadsworth had
gone into a land deal of considerable proportions.
Several important transactions had resulted, and
in making one of the deals Mr. Wadsworth and
Mr. Basswood had become possessed of the two
bungalows on Mirror Lake, the two gentlemen
owning both jointly.</p>

<p>At first, on acquiring the property, the jewelry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>manufacturer had been in favor of selling it at
public auction; but to this Mr. Basswood had demurred.</p>

<p>"I think, Mr. Wadsworth," he had said, "if
we hold that property for a few years it will be
far more valuable than it is now. The State road
has been built to within a few miles, and there is
strong talk of its being carried directly past Mirror
Lake. Not only that; there is also talk of the
railroad putting in a spur through that district,
and of course that will help a great deal."</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Basswood. If you think we
ought to hold the land, we'll do it," had been Mr.
Wadsworth's reply. "But what are we going to
do with the bungalows in the meantime?"</p>

<p>"We can either use them or rent them," had
been the answer.</p>

<p>For the past season, and also during the early
part of the present summer, the two bungalows
had been leased to some people from Rochester.
But now both bungalows were unoccupied.</p>

<p>It had been Dunston Porter's suggestion that
they go up to Mirror Lake on the return from
the trip to Yellowstone Park, and this idea had
been quickly seconded by the young folks, especially
by Laura and Jessie, who had never as yet
spent any time in the Adirondacks.</p>

<p>"They tell me the mountains are lovely, especially
during the autumn," said the daughter of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>the jewelry manufacturer. "Oh, let us go, by all
means!"</p>

<p>"I am sure I would like it," Laura had answered.
"But who will go with us?"</p>

<p>The matter had been talked over while the
young folks were returning from Yellowstone
Park, and also while Dave and Ben were at home,
as well as during the voyage on the <i>Eaglet</i>. As
a result it had been arranged that Mr. and Mrs.
Basswood were to go up for part of the time, and
also Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth. Laura and
Jessie, as well as Belle Endicott, who was coming
East, were to go, along with Dave and Ben and
a number of their chums. Mr. Dunston Porter
and Dave's father said they would make several
trips back and forth during the time the others
were up there. It may be said here that the
bungalows were fully furnished, so our friends
had no anxiety on that score.</p>

<p>"We'll have the best time ever, Jessie," said
Dave, in talking the matter over the day after his
arrival home. "I am sure you will like it."</p>

<p>"Have you your things packed, Dave?" questioned
his sister, who was present. "You don't
want to leave that until the last minute."</p>

<p>"Oh, packing is getting easy to me, Laura. I
feel like a regular traveler since I took those trips
to Cave Island, and after the runaways, and to
the Landslide Mine and Yellowstone Park."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>"Oh, it was splendid, the way you relocated
that gold mine, Dave!" cried Jessie. "How
glad Roger and his folks must have been."</p>

<p>"They surely were glad," answered the youth.
"I never saw Roger look so happy in my life.
It took a big weight off his shoulders."</p>

<p>"And, just to think that they are going to give
you and Phil an interest in that mine!" remarked
Laura. "Why, Dave, if you keep on, you'll be
a rich man some day."</p>

<p>"Well, I sha'n't complain if I am," answered
the brother, coolly.</p>

<p>It had been arranged that the start for Mirror
Lake should be made on the following Monday
morning. Some of the folks were to go as far as
they could by train, but the young people had demurred,
stating that they wanted if possible to
make the trip by automobile.</p>

<p>"We can take our machine and the Basswood
car," said Dave. "It won't take us more than
two or three days, and it will be lots of fun."</p>

<p>"But what are we going to do with the automobiles
after we reach Carpen Falls?" asked
Dunston Porter. "You can't go any farther in
an auto than that."</p>

<p>"Isn't there some sort of garage at Carpen
Falls?" questioned Ben, who was present.</p>

<p>"Probably there is. Anyway, I know there is
a livery stable there."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>"Then we could leave the machines there until
we were ready to bring them back," replied
Dave.</p>

<p>"We'll see about this later," said Dave's father,
with a shake of his head. Automobiling did not
appeal to him quite as strongly as it did to his son
and his brother.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful afternoon, and Dave and
Ben had arranged for a little run in the automobile,
taking Laura and Jessie along. Dave ran
the car, with Jessie on the seat beside him. Their
course was out of Crumville, and then over the
distant hills to a winding road which ran beside
the river.</p>

<p>"It seems so strange, Dave, to think you are
not going back to Oak Hall this fall," remarked
Jessie, when the automobile was bowling along
over the smooth highway.</p>

<p>"It does seem strange," was Dave's somewhat
grave reply. "Do you know, sometimes I wish
I were going back again."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well, if I had to do that I wouldn't have to
bother about anything else just now, Jessie. As
it is, I've got to make up my mind what I am
going to do. One minute I think I want to go to
college, and the next I have a notion of going into
some sort of business."</p>

<p>"What does your father say, Dave?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>"He is leaving it entirely to me. He says if
I want to go to college I can do so."</p>

<p>"What would you like to do best of all?"</p>

<p>"Oh, as for that, I'd like to travel, just as
Uncle Dunston does. I'd like to see the world."</p>

<p>"I suppose that would be nice, Dave. But
still a person can't be traveling all the time," and
Jessie's face clouded a trifle.</p>

<p>"I shouldn't want to be traveling all the time,
Jessie. Some day I'll want to settle down." He
gave her an earnest look. "I thought that was
all settled."</p>

<p>"Settled? What?" And the girl gave him
a quick look in return.</p>

<p>"Why, that I was going to settle down some
day, and that you were going to settle down with
me."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! That's the first I ever heard
of it."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you know, Jessie&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dave, do you know that Laura and Ben are
sitting right behind us?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but they are busy with their own talk."</p>

<p>"Maybe you only think so."</p>

<p>"All right. But it's settled; isn't it, Jessie?"</p>

<p>"I don't know that anything is settled." Jessie
was gazing straight ahead at the road.
"How about that beautiful young lady you rescued
from drowning?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>"Oh, say! Please don't bring that up,"
pleaded Dave, hastily. "That was all some of
Ben's nonsense."</p>

<p>"But you did pull her out of the water; didn't
you, Dave?"</p>

<p>"What if I did? You wouldn't have me let
her drown; would you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, of course not. But still Ben said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, there you go again! Didn't I tell you
that was only some of Ben's nonsense? You
mustn't believe a word he says."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I always thought Ben was a very
truthful boy."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you're going to make a mountain
out of a molehill&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I haven't made a mountain out of anything,
Dave."</p>

<p>"Say, who's talking about mountains on the
front seat?" interrupted Ben. "I thought we
were going down on the river road."</p>

<p>"So we are," declared Dave, somewhat sharply.</p>

<p>"I hope we can go up to the Adirondacks in
the autos," said Laura, eagerly. "It will surely
make a splendid trip."</p>

<p>"If we go in the autos who is going to drive?"
questioned Jessie.</p>

<p>"I'll run our car, and I suppose Dave will run
this one," answered Ben. "But we can change
off with the other fellows if we want to."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>The top of a small hill had been reached, and
now the automobile glided down the other side
in the direction of the river road. Here the way
narrowed a trifle, and Dave had to give all his
attention to the running of the car. As the automobile
turned in toward the stream, they passed
several other touring-cars, and then came in sight
of a horse attached to a buggy, the two wheels of
which were deep in a ditch.</p>

<p>"Hello! That's Mr. Aaron Poole's buggy!"
exclaimed Dave.</p>

<p>"Yes. But it is Nat who is driving," returned
Ben.</p>

<p>Mr. Aaron Poole was a rich money-lender, who
lived not far from Crumville, and who had a son
Nat, who had gone to Oak Hall with Dave and
Ben. Mr. Poole was a very grasping man, and
in the past he and the Porters had had a number
of differences. Nat had been almost as overbearing
as his father, but during the early part of
the summer he had told Dave that he was going
to turn over a new leaf. And since that time our
hero had heard that the money-lender's son was
quite a different sort of a boy, and growing better
every day.</p>

<p>"Hello, Nat! What's the trouble?" questioned
Dave, as he brought the automobile to a
standstill beside the buggy.</p>

<p>"Trouble enough!" grumbled the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>money-lender's
son. "Did you notice those automobiles
that just went by?"</p>

<p>"I certainly did. They were going at some
speed."</p>

<p>"They were racing, that's what they were doing!"
explained Nat Poole. "They were racing,
and they made such a racket that it scared my
horse and he landed me here in this ditch."</p>

<p>"It's a good thing they didn't upset you, Nat,"
said Ben.</p>

<p>"If they upset me, I would make them pay for
the damages," retorted the youth in the buggy.</p>

<p>"Did you know them, Nat?" asked Laura,
kindly.</p>

<p>"I know one of them. He's a high-flyer from
Pittstown. The next time I see him I'll give him
a piece of my mind. They've got no right to use
this road for a race-track."</p>

<p>"Did they hurt you at all?" queried Jessie.</p>

<p>"I don't know as they did. But this mud in
the ditch is mighty sticky, and I don't see how I
am going to get out of it," grumbled the money-lender's
son.</p>

<p>"Maybe we can give you a lift, Nat," said
Dave, and got out of the automobile, followed by
Ben. "Here, I'll hold the horse while you get
out."</p>

<p>"Be careful. He's mighty skittish," warned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>the other. "If he gets to kicking he'll smash the
buggy into kindling-wood."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid of him," answered Dave, and
took a firm hold on the horse's bridle. Then Nat
leaped from the buggy, and he and Ben took hold
of the wheels and pushed, while Dave led the horse
forward. By this means, in a minute more, the
turnout was safe in the middle of the roadway.</p>

<p>"Much obliged to you fellows for this," remarked
the money-lender's son, when all danger
seemed past.</p>

<p>"Don't mention it, Nat. I am glad to help
you," returned Dave, quickly.</p>

<p>"And so am I," added Ben.</p>

<p>"Funny thing," went on the money-lender's
son. "I was coming around to your house to see
you," and he glanced quickly at our hero.</p>

<p>"Well, you'll have to come, Nat, some time
when I am home," answered Dave. "We are
going off on another trip next Monday."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Then I'm glad I met you as I
did, because I wanted to see you before you went
away. I've got some strange news to tell you."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Link Merwell is alive. He wasn't killed in
that landslide at all," was Nat Poole's astonishing
reply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h2>NEWS OF IMPORTANCE</h2>
<br />

<p>"Link Merwell!"</p>

<p>"Nat, you must be fooling!" put in Ben.</p>

<p>"Why, we couldn't find a single trace of him
after that awful landslide!" went on Dave.
"We made a thorough search, too."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that," returned
the money-lender's son. "But I know Link Merwell
is alive. I got a letter from him yesterday."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that it was not an old letter delayed
in delivery?" queried Ben.</p>

<p>"No, it was not an old letter. It was dated
only a few days ago. It was sent to me from
Boston."</p>

<p>"Boston!" cried Laura. "Then he must not
only be alive, but he must have followed us East."</p>

<p>"Did he say anything about Job Haskers?"
queried our hero.</p>

<p>"He said he didn't know what had become of
Haskers. He said they had separated a short
while before the big landslide struck them. He
was pretty well bruised up, and had to rest in a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>little mining camp up in the mountains for two
weeks."</p>

<p>"This is certainly the strangest news yet," was
Dave's comment. "I thought sure that he and
Haskers had been swallowed up in that landslide,
along with that miner who was with them. Nat,
what caused him to write to you? I thought you
told me that you had destroyed his last letter without
answering it."</p>

<p>"So I did destroy it, Dave, without answering
it," returned the money-lender's son. "I was as
surprised to hear from him as you would have
been. I thought he would know enough to let me
alone."</p>

<p>"What did he have to say, Nat?" questioned
Ben. "Of course you haven't got to tell us if
you don't want to," he added, hastily.</p>

<p>"That's all right. Didn't I tell you I was coming
to see Dave? I was going to show him the
letter. I've got it in my pocket. Here it is," and
Nat brought forth the communication.</p>

<p>The letter was a long and rambling one which
need not be reproduced here. In it Link Merwell
told something of how he had been caught in the
landslide, and how he had escaped and had been
carried by some miners to their camp. A search
had been made for Job Haskers and the man
named Blugg, but without results. Then Merwell
had obtained some money (probably from his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>father), and had come East, where he expected to
obtain a position. He added that he was still as
bitter as ever against Dave and his chums, and
would do his best some day to "square accounts."
As in his previous communication to Nat, he
wanted to know if the money-lender's son would
not aid him in making trouble for our hero.</p>

<p>"The same old Link Merwell!" remarked
Dave, after he had read the letter, with Ben looking
over his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you think a fellow who had been so
close to death would want to reform?" said his
chum. "But I suppose Link doesn't know what
the word, 'reform,' means."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, aren't you afraid he will make you
a lot of trouble?" cried Jessie, and her face
showed her deep concern.</p>

<p>"I never was afraid of Link Merwell, and I
don't believe I ever shall be," returned Dave,
quickly. "At heart I think that fellow is a big
coward."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you must be careful," warned his
sister. "Even cowards know how to strike in the
dark, and that would be Link Merwell's way of attacking
you."</p>

<p>"I don't know how he is going to hurt Dave
when he is away off in Boston," was Ben's comment.
"The chances are he has got to go to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>work and earn his living. Probably his father is
sick of putting up money for him."</p>

<p>"Merwell mustn't forget one thing," said Dave.
"He is still responsible for his part in that jewelry
robbery. If the authorities get hold of him, they
will certainly send him to prison. So far as that
affair is concerned, he was no better than Jasniff."</p>

<p>"What makes me mad is his trying to connect-up
with me," burst out Nat. "I've told him
twice now that I was done with him, and I want
him to leave me alone."</p>

<p>"Were you going to answer this letter, Nat?"
questioned Ben.</p>

<p>"No. I was going to tear it up, the same as
the other. It's only got 'Boston' for an address,
anyway."</p>

<p>"It seems to me, Nat, it might be a good thing
for you to write to Link and tell him exactly what
you think of him," said Dave. "Tell him you are
done with him forever, and that you don't want to
get any more letters. Perhaps that will settle
him. Send the letter to the General Delivery."</p>

<p>"That's what I was going to ask you about,
Dave. I don't want to have that fellow bothering
me. I told you I was going to turn over a
new leaf." And now for once in his life, Nat
Poole looked Dave and then Ben squarely in the
face.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>"Then, by all means, write to him and tell him
exactly where you stand," went on our hero.
"Make the letter good and strong, Nat, so that
there won't be any mistake about it."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," answered the money-lender's son.
And then after a few words more, he replaced the
letter in his pocket and drove on, and Dave and
his party resumed their automobile trip.</p>

<p>"That certainly is news," was Ben's comment,
as they rolled along the river road. "I thought
from what you said, Dave, he must have been
buried alive."</p>

<p>"So we all thought. His escape must have
been nothing short of a miracle."</p>

<p>"I don't begrudge him his life, but I don't want
him to bother Dave any more," said Laura. "He
is such a wicked fellow."</p>

<p>"Dave, didn't you say, after you came from
Cave Island, that Link said something about reforming?"
asked Jessie.</p>

<p>"Yes, he did talk that way. He was very
humble, and sorry that he had gone into the robbery
with Jasniff. But I guess now that what
made him humble was the fact that he was in danger
of going to prison. As soon as he got away,
his ideas changed."</p>

<p>"I hope he doesn't come here to bother you,
Dave," sighed Laura.</p>

<p>"Oh, please don't think of such a dreadful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>thing!" cried Jessie. "If he is in Boston, I hope
he stays there." But this wish was not to be fulfilled,
as we shall see later.</p>

<p>The ride along the river road and over the hills
beyond was much enjoyed by the young folks, and
it was after dark when they returned to Crumville.
All told, Jessie made it very pleasant for Dave, but
she could not forget the fact that the youth had
rescued Della Ford from the sea, and she asked
several times about the young lady and the moving-picture
company to which she belonged.</p>

<p>"I don't know much about the picture company,"
Dave had answered. "I think there were
about a dozen people in it, including Miss Ford's
aunt and the young fellow and the fat man we
picked up."</p>

<p>"But you said you would call on her in Boston;
didn't you?" queried Jessie.</p>

<p>"I said I might call if I was in the city," Dave
replied.</p>

<p>"And I suppose you'll go up there the first
chance you get," pouted Jessie.</p>

<p>"Maybe," he answered, not altogether liking
her tone. And then before anything more could
be said the automobile swept up in front of Ben
Basswood's home, and the conversation became
general.</p>

<p>Ben had been on the back seat with Laura, and
now as he left the party, Jessie came into the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>tonneau
to keep Dave's sister company, so that on
the journey to the Wadsworth mansion the talk between
Jessie and Dave could not be renewed.</p>

<p>The next two days were busy ones for our hero.
He had several matters of business to attend to
for his father and his uncle. Added to this, old
Caspar Potts asked the youth if he would not accompany
him to the old farm where the pair had
spent so long a time together.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, I'll go to the farm with you,
Professor," replied Dave. "But what are you
going to do there, if I may ask?"</p>

<p>"I want to get a box of books that was left in
the garret there when we came away," answered
the old, white-haired gentleman. "I would have
brought them here before, but it slipped my mind
entirely. Perhaps you remember the box?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean that old blue box that stood in
the back of the garret?" questioned Dave.</p>

<p>"That's the one, David. I don't think the
books in it are of very great value, but they might
as well be added to the library here," went on the
old professor. The Wadsworth library comprised
many hundreds of volumes, and was a
source of great pride to Professor Potts, who had
spent many days in classifying the books and getting
out a private catalogue. To please the old
gentleman, Mr. Wadsworth had, from time to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>time, added various books and pamphlets which he
might not otherwise have purchased.</p>

<p>Since Dave and Caspar Potts had left the old
farm, the place had been leased to another party,
but now it was unoccupied, and the cottage and
stable were locked up.</p>

<p>"Looks natural," remarked Dave, as he stood
on the tiny piazza of the cottage and looked
around on the familiar scene. Then his thoughts
went back to the past. What tremendous changes
had taken place since he had left that home! He
had found a father, a sister, and an uncle, and had
made a host of friends. Not only that; he was
rich, and had received a good education, and was
on the fair road to success.</p>

<p>"David!" It was Caspar Potts who spoke,
and his voice trembled. "How different it is
from what it used to be! Certainly your folks
and Mr. Wadsworth have been great friends of
mine," and the old gentleman blinked away the
tears that stood in his mild eyes.</p>

<p>Unlocking the door of the little cottage, Dave
went inside and lost no time in throwing open a
number of windows, so that the fresh summer air
from outside might dispel the dampness within.
Then Caspar Potts entered, and both ascended the
narrow stairway to the upper floor. Here was a
tiny garret, which in the past had been given over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>mostly to the storage of old furniture and other
articles not in use.</p>

<p>"I trust none of the tenants have disturbed that
box," remarked Caspar Potts, when Dave had lit a
candle which he had thoughtfully brought along.</p>

<p>"I see the box, Professor," answered the youth.
"Here, if you will hold the candle I will get it
out." And then Dave worked his way over to a
corner under the eaves, and from behind a broken
rocking-chair and a dilapidated couch, dragged
forth a small wooden box, painted blue. He
threw back the cover, exposing to view thirty or
forty books, covered with dust and yellow with
age.</p>

<p>"Good! good!" murmured the old professor,
as he brushed one of the volumes off with his coat
sleeve. "Some of these books are not very valuable,
David, but a few of them will add quite a
little to our library. I had those volumes when I
was a student at college," he added proudly.</p>

<p>"I'll carry the box downstairs," said Dave.</p>

<p>Caspar Potts, candle in hand, led the way to the
floor below. As he came out into the kitchen of
the cottage, he was somewhat surprised to find two
persons on the porch, talking earnestly.</p>

<p>"Hello, you've got visitors!" said Dave, as he
set the box of books down on a bare table.
"Some one out for a look around, I suppose," he
added.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>"Maybe it is some one who would like to lease
the farm," returned Caspar Potts. "Let us go
out and see," and he extinguished the candle.</p>

<p>Brushing the dust and cobwebs from his coat,
Dave followed the old professor to the porch of
the cottage. The two visitors were so busy talking
that, for the instant, they did not notice the
others.</p>

<p>"Hello there!" exclaimed Dave, in some surprise,
as his eyes rested on the face of one of the
visitors. "How in the world did you get here?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;I&mdash;er&mdash;It's Mr. Porter!" stammered
the fellow addressed, and he leaped quickly
to his feet.</p>

<p>It was Ward Porton, the young man Dave and
his chums had rescued from the sea when the
steam yacht was on fire.</p>

<p>"Dave Porter! Here!" came from the other
fellow who had been seated on the stoop, and now
he too leaped up. "&mdash;I guess we had better
leave," he stammered.</p>

<p>"Link Merwell!" ejaculated our hero. It
must be confessed that now he was all but dumfounded.
He had thought that Link Merwell
must be in Boston, and to find him here on the
outskirts of Crumville, and in company with Ward
Porton, the fellow he had rescued, was almost beyond
belief.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h2>LINK MERWELL AGAIN</h2>

<p>Link Merwell showed signs of both suffering
and dissipation. His face was thin and careworn,
and his eyes had an uncertain, restless look in them.
He had on a business suit much the worse for
wear, and his tan shoes were worn down at the
heels. Evidently he had not fared well since
Dave had met him in the West.</p>

<p>"I once thought you were dead, Link," went on
Dave, after a pause, during which Link Merwell
had taken several steps away from the cottage.
"I thought you had been buried by that landslide."</p>

<p>"I know it," was the bitter reply. "It would
have pleased you immensely if I had been buried
alive."</p>

<p>"That isn't true. I wouldn't like to see anybody
lose his life in that fashion," declared Dave.
And then he went on quickly: "Did Job Haskers
escape?"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about him&mdash;and
I don't want to know," returned Link Merwell,
and his tone was as bitter as before. "Haskers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>didn't treat me right, and we separated before we
got caught in the sliding rocks and dirt."</p>

<p>"I didn't know that you knew Merwell," said
Dave, turning to Ward Porton.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I have known him for some time,"
was the reply of the young moving-picture actor.</p>

<p>"I think we had better be going," broke out
Link Merwell, who had retreated a step or two
further. He showed very plainly that he was
afraid Dave might lay hands on him.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be in a hurry," answered Ward Porton.
"Now we've got the chance, I'd like to talk
to Porter."</p>

<p>"I don't think I'll stay," and Link Merwell
moved still farther away. "I'll meet you later,
you know where."</p>

<p>"See here, Link! Don't be in such a hurry,"
cried Dave, advancing toward the youth. "I
want to talk to you."</p>

<p>"I know your game, Dave Porter! You want
to catch me and hand me over to the authorities!"
exclaimed Link, and showed more fear than ever.</p>

<p>"What makes you think that?"</p>

<p>"Never mind, you're not going to catch me this
way! Don't forget, Porton. I'll see you later,"
and thus speaking, Link Merwell turned and
started away on a swift walk. Then, as Dave
went after him, he broke into a run, and reaching
the roadway, dived into the woods beyond.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>"My, my!" came from old Professor Potts.
"David, why did he run away?"</p>

<p>"He's afraid of being arrested; that's why,
Professor," explained our hero. "Don't you remember,
he is one of the villainous fellows who
robbed Mr. Wadsworth's jewelry works a year
or so ago?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, to be sure!" murmured the old
gentleman. "I remember now. What an awful
thing for a young man like that to be such a criminal!"</p>

<p>"You say he is a criminal?" asked Ward Porton,
curiously.</p>

<p>"He certainly is," answered Dave.</p>

<p>"Hum! I didn't know that," returned the
young moving-picture actor, and for the moment
looked quite thoughtful.</p>

<p>"May I ask what brought you to Crumville?"
queried our hero. "I thought you and your company
were bound for Boston."</p>

<p>"We did go to Boston, and the company is
there now, unless it has gone up into the woods. I
had a little business in this vicinity, and so I came
here before going on the next trip with them."</p>

<p>"Did you come to Crumville with Merwell?"</p>

<p>"I did, but I didn't know he was a criminal."</p>

<p>"Then you must have met Merwell in
Boston?"</p>

<p>"No, I met him on the steam yacht."</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>"The steam yacht! Do you mean the one that
caught fire?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Then Link Merwell was on board that
vessel?" cried Dave, in added wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Was he a member of your company?"</p>

<p>"He was. Mr. Appleby, our manager, took
him on the day before we went on the trip. I
don't know where Mr. Appleby met him."</p>

<p>"That certainly beats the Dutch! Of course,
Merwell must have seen me and my friends in the
rowboat."</p>

<p>"He said he did."</p>

<p>"He took good pains to keep out of sight!"</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that, Porter.
But he was on the boat, you can take my word for
that."</p>

<p>"And is he a regular member of your company?"</p>

<p>"He is to be, provided he can make good at
the business. I think he came to Mr. Appleby
with some sort of a hard-luck story, and the manager
said he would give him a chance. Privately,
though, I don't think he's very much of an actor.
But then you know, a fellow has got to do something
for a living."</p>

<p>"He can probably act as well as the majority,"
answered Dave. "But I am surprised to learn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>that he was on the steam yacht and didn't show
himself to us. Still, he was probably afraid to do
so, and glad enough to keep out of sight. I suppose
he brought you to this farm?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we just took a walk up this way," returned
Ward Porton, with some hesitation. He gave
Dave a keen look. "You see, I was on my way
to the Crumville poorhouse. By the way, Merwell
told me that you had once been connected with
that institution," and he gave Dave another keen
look.</p>

<p>Our hero's face flushed, and for the instant he
did not know what to say. Caspar Potts, too,
showed confusion.</p>

<p>"David was not&mdash;er&mdash;connected with that
institution, sir," said the old gentleman, hurriedly.
"He was placed there when he was a
child by those who found him wandering along
the railroad tracks here. They did not know who
he was, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think Mr. Porton will be interested in
that story, Professor," interrupted our hero.</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth I am interested," answered
Ward Porton. "I once lived in a poorhouse
myself."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Is that so?" murmured Caspar
Potts. "How interesting!"</p>

<p>"It wasn't anywhere around here, though,"
went on the young moving-picture actor. "It was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>'way down East. And believe me, it was a hard
life! I don't really see how I pulled through,"
and he smiled, grimly.</p>

<p>"I can't say that I had such a very hard time
of it," said Dave. "They treated me fairly well,
and as soon as I got old enough to work, Mr.
Potts here took me and not only gave me a good
home, but also the beginning of a good education.
Then, after that, I found my folks&mdash;I had
been stolen away from them you see when a baby&mdash;and
since that time I have had an easy time
of it."</p>

<p>"You're the lucky one then," answered Ward
Porton. He seemed on the point of saying something
more, but evidently changed his mind.
"Well, if it's all the same to you, I'll be going,"
he concluded.</p>

<p>"Better take my advice, and drop Link Merwell,"
said Dave, as the young man moved away.
"If you don't, sooner or later he'll get you into hot
water. The authorities want him, even though
they got back the things he stole."</p>

<p>"I'll remember what you say," was the answer,
and then the young moving-picture actor walked
away, and soon disappeared around a bend of the
road.</p>

<p>"It is very strange that they should have come
here," remarked Caspar Potts, when he and Dave
re-entered the cottage to get the box of books.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>"I should say it was!" answered our hero.
"I don't understand it at all. I believe Link
Merwell is up to another one of his tricks. I'm
going to keep my eyes open for him."</p>

<p>When Dave returned home he told the others
there of having met Link Merwell and Ward
Porton. Mr. Wadsworth was, of course, particularly
interested in Merwell, and he at once telephoned
to the authorities to be on the lookout for
that individual. But Link Merwell had probably
taken warning, and did not show himself again.
Nor, for the time being, did Dave see anything
further of Ward Porton.</p>

<p>On Friday Belle Endicott, Laura's friend from
the West, arrived, and was followed on Saturday
morning by Roger and Phil. Ben brought word
that he had written to Luke Watson and Shadow
Hamilton, and that those two former pupils of
Oak Hall had also signified their willingness to accompany
the party to Mirror Lake.</p>

<p>"And say, Dave, what do you think!" cried
Ben. "This place that we are to go to at Mirror
Lake is known as Bear Camp. They tell me the
bears just love that vicinity."</p>

<p>"Bear Camp!" shrieked Jessie, who was present.
"Oh, Ben, you are fooling!"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, Jessie. My father got a letter
from Tad Rason, an old hunter and guide who
lives in the vicinity of Mirror Lake. He says that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>that place has been known as Bear Camp for years.
He told about shooting a big black bear there only
a year or so ago."</p>

<p>"O dear, if there are bears up there I don't
know that I want to go!" said Laura. "Just
think of having a big bear chase you!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you mustn't mind that, Laura!" cried
Dave, gaily. "Just think of the nice hug he
could give you," and then he dodged, as Laura
threw a fancy pillow at him.</p>

<p>"I think those bears will spoil everything,"
came from Jessie, her face clouding. "I didn't
know any wild animals were left in the Adirondacks."</p>

<p>"Bear Camp," mused Laura. "What a queer
name that is!"</p>

<p>"I think it's a fine name," answered Ben. "It
suits me, anyway."</p>

<p>The boys were glad to see Belle Endicott, who
was a large, well-built girl, with a bright, breezy,
western air about her. Belle had much to tell concerning
matters at Star Ranch; and Dave asked
her about many of the friends he had made among
the cowboys at the place.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll just love to see bears," said Belle,
when told about the camp. "They are such
funny, clumsy creatures. Why, I once saw a little
cinnamon bear climbing up a tree, and he was the
funniest fellow I ever looked at."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>"Oh, Belle! Weren't you frightened?" asked
Jessie.</p>

<p>"Frightened? What, with Sid Todd with me?
No, indeed! We just watched him until we got
tired of it, and then Todd up with his rifle, and
that was the end of Mr. Cinnamon Bear."</p>

<p>"Good for Sid!" cried Dave. "He was always
on hand when wanted. I'd like to see him
again."</p>

<p>"Well, he sent his regards to you, Dave," was
Belle's rejoinder.</p>

<p>Shadow Hamilton and Luke Watson, the latter
carrying a case containing his guitar and his banjo,
arrived on Saturday afternoon. They came to
Ben's house, and, having been notified by telephone,
Dave hurried over to see them.</p>

<p>"Dave, you're a sight for sore eyes!" said
Luke Watson, as he gave our hero's hand a grasp
that made him wince. "My gracious, it seems to
me that I haven't seen you in a year of Sundays!"</p>

<p>"One thing's sure, Luke," answered Dave, with
a twinkle in his eyes. "You haven't seen me since
I've seen you," and at this remark both laughed.</p>

<p>"Luke has brought his instruments along,"
said Ben, "so we'll be sure to have plenty of music
up at the camp."</p>

<p>"It suits me, and will surely suit the girls," returned
Dave. "We can sit out in the moonlight
nights, and have fine times singing," he added.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>"Say! talking about singing in the moonlight,
puts me in mind of a story," burst out Shadow.
"Once on a time a young fellow went to serenade
his girl, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind the yarn now, Shadow," said Ben.
"I've got something to tell you that is more interesting
than a story. It's about Nat Poole's uncle."</p>

<p>"Nat Poole's uncle?" queried Dave. "You
don't mean Wilbur Poole, the wild man we caught
in the woods back of Oakdale?"</p>

<p>"That is the man."</p>

<p>"What of him? I thought they had taken him
to a sanitarium, and that he was getting better."</p>

<p>"So he was getting better&mdash;in fact he was
almost well, so Nat said. But now what do you
think has happened?"</p>

<p>"What?" came from all of the other boys.</p>

<p>"He has disappeared."</p>

<p>"Disappeared?"</p>

<p>"That's it. He has run away, and nobody
knows where he went to."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h2>OFF FOR BEAR CAMP</h2>
<br />

<p>"Who told you this, Ben?" asked Dave.</p>

<p>"I just got the story from Nat. He and his
family are very much worried. They had an idea
that Wilbur Poole was practically well again, and
that is the reason why they did not watch him very
closely."</p>

<p>"Of course they are searching for him?"</p>

<p>"Sure! Nat said the authorities and also several
other people were after him. Nat himself
was going to look for him to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Maybe we'll run across him," said Luke Watson.</p>

<p>"I hope we don't, Luke!" exclaimed Dave.
"That man gave us trouble enough up at Oak
Hall."</p>

<p>"Right you are there!" burst out Shadow.
And then he added: "I wonder if he'll call himself
the King of Sumatra, as he did before?"</p>

<p>"A man who is out of his mind is apt to call
himself anything," said Dave. "I feel sorry
for Nat. This must worry him and his family a
good deal."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>It was not long after this when all the boys went
over to the Wadsworth mansion, there to complete
their preparations for the trip to Mirror Lake.
Ben had had the Basswood automobile thoroughly
overhauled, and Dave had likewise had the Wadsworth
touring-car put into the best possible running
shape.</p>

<p>"My, but there is going to be quite a bunch of
us!" was Dave's comment, as he looked at the
boys and girls who were present.</p>

<p>"Mamma says we must finish all our packing
to-night or else do it Monday morning," said
Jessie. "She doesn't want any of it done on Sunday."</p>

<p>"My things are all ready, and so are Belle's,"
returned Laura. "But I don't know how it is
with the boys."</p>

<p>"We'll be all right; don't you worry," answered
Dave.</p>

<p>"We never got left yet," added Ben, with a
grin.</p>

<p>Luke had brought along his banjo, and the
others insisted that he play a tune or two. Then
they sang a couple of songs; and after that the
Wadsworth phonograph was started, and the
young folks enjoyed an hour or so of dancing.</p>

<p>Sunday morning most of the young folks went
to church, and in the afternoon some of them spent
their time in writing letters. Dave and several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>of the boys took a walk around the town. At the
railroad station they ran across Nat Poole.</p>

<p>"I am off to look for my Uncle Wilbur," said
Nat. "We've an idea that he went to Plattsburg,
New York. He used to have some friends there,
and we think he started off to visit them."</p>

<p>"I certainly hope you find him, Nat, and that
he's all right," answered Dave, kindly.</p>

<p>"By the way, I heard Link Merwell was in
town," went on the money-lender's son.</p>

<p>"Yes. I met him at our old farm."</p>

<p>"I should think he'd be afraid to show himself,
fearing arrest."</p>

<p>"He's a strange fellow, Nat, and there is no
telling what he will do. He has been knocked
around so much the last few months that I suppose
he doesn't care very much what happens
next."</p>

<p>"I don't want to see him. I've got troubles
enough without running into Link Merwell,"
grumbled Nat; and then his train came in and he
was off.</p>

<p>During their spare time the boys had studied an
automobile road-map of New York State, and
especially of the Adirondack Mountains. They
had figured out that they would have good traveling
nearly the whole of the distance, although
there were a few bad stretches here and there to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>be covered, and also a number of mountains to be
climbed.</p>

<p>"But the mountains won't bother us," said
Dave, in reply to a question from Luke. "Our
car can go up almost any hill, and the Basswood
auto is just about as good. Of course we'll have
to do some of the traveling on low or second
gear."</p>

<p>"The reason I asked was this," returned Luke.
"A couple of years ago some friends of mine
started to tour the Adirondacks in a runabout.
They went up the side of one mountain, and then
down on the other. They then found themselves
in a valley, and couldn't climb the grade on either
side. They tried for two days to get out, and
then had to get a team of horses to pull them a distance
of several miles."</p>

<p>"We'll watch out that nothing like that happens
to us," answered Dave. "We won't go
down into any hollow until we know something
about how we are going to get out of it."</p>

<p>As both touring-cars were large, it had been decided
that Mr. and Mrs. Basswood, as well as
Dunston Porter, should accompany the young
folks on the automobile trip. As all the baggage
had been packed and either shipped forward by
express or strapped on the touring-cars, it did not
take long on Monday morning to get ready to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>start. It was a clear and fairly cool day, and a
slight shower Sunday night had laid the dust.</p>

<p>"All aboard that's going!" cried Dave, gaily,
when the Wadsworth car had been run around to
the front of the mansion.</p>

<p>He had hardly uttered the words when there
came the sound of an automobile horn from the
road, and a few seconds later the Basswood car
came into sight with Ben's crowd on board.</p>

<p>"You'll say good-bye to us here, but we'll be at
Mirror Lake before you get there," said Mrs.
Wadsworth, as she kissed her daughter and the
other girls.</p>

<p>"Now look out for accidents!" cautioned
Dave's father.</p>

<p>"We'll be careful," answered Dunston Porter,
with a smile. And then he added to Caspar
Potts: "Professor, don't forget to take good
care of the place while we are away."</p>

<p>"It shall be well taken care of, rest assured of
that, sir," was the old gentleman's reply. "I
trust all of you enjoy the outing," he went on, his
kindly face beaming.</p>

<p>Dave was at the wheel, with his uncle beside
him, and the others packed rather tightly in the
tonneau behind. With many a shout and merry
word, the Wadsworth touring-car left the grounds,
followed by the Basswood machine, and passed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>out along the highway leading north from Crumville.</p>

<p>"Now Dave, do look where you are running,"
cautioned Laura. "We don't want any punctures
or blow-outs."</p>

<p>Soon Crumville was left behind, and the automobiles
were passing along the river road where
some time before Dave and his chums had assisted
Nat Poole. Then they began to climb the distant
hills, and presently were on the highway leading
to Poughkeepsie, where they were to cross the
Hudson River.</p>

<p>"If only this lovely weather holds out I'm sure
we'll have a splendid trip," said Jessie.</p>

<p>"I suppose, Belle, you'd rather be on horseback
than in an auto," remarked Phil.</p>

<p>"Well, I won't go back on horseback-riding,"
returned the western girl, "I love it too dearly.
But this is very nice," she added, quickly. "Very
nice indeed!"</p>

<p>By noon they reached the city on the Hudson
River, and there stopped for lunch. Then they
passed over the high bridge spanning the stream
and struck out northward once more. Mr. Dunston
Porter was now running the car, and this gave
Dave more of a chance to talk to those behind
him.</p>

<p>That evening found them in Albany, where it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>had been decided to spend the night. Dunston
Porter had already telegraphed ahead for hotel
accommodations, so there was no difficulty on that
score. The older folks were glad enough to rest
during the evening, but the young people went out
for a walk up the hill leading to the Capitol building.</p>

<p>In the morning the tourists were rather alarmed
to see that the sky had clouded over, and there
were some indications of rain.</p>

<p>"Well, if it rains we can put on our raincoats
and put up the tops," said Dave. So far they had
been traveling with the tops folded down.</p>

<p>Noon found them well up in the heart of New
York State. They stopped only for a short while
at lunch time, wishing to cover as much ground as
possible before the storm might break.</p>

<p>"If possible we want to make Rayville to-day,"
announced Mr. Basswood, when the two cars had
come to a standstill at a crossroads. "I've got
some friends living there, and I want to make a
call on them. Besides, there's a good hotel there,
where we can stop for the night," for they had
made no arrangements beyond Albany.</p>

<p>There had been a signboard at the crossroads,
but this had fallen down, so the tourists did not
know which of the forks of the road to take.
Finally a man, coming along in a runabout, told
them to take the highway on the left.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>"That other road is the regular one," he explained,
"but it is pretty well torn up, and you'll
make time by taking this one. But be careful of
the hill, it's just a little bit dangerous."</p>

<p>"We'll be careful," answered Dave, who was
now running the car once more.</p>

<p>"Want me to take the wheel?" questioned his
uncle.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, I guess I can get along all right."</p>

<p>The Basswood car, with Ben in charge, had already
taken to the highway on the left, and the
other turnout followed it at a distance of several
hundred feet. Ben had put on considerable speed,
and Dave had to watch closely to keep the other
car in sight.</p>

<p>"Take it easy, Davy," said his Uncle Dunston.
"We don't want any accidents away out here from
any garage."</p>

<p>"I want to keep Ben in sight. He's going it
pretty lively," answered Dave.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a wonder his father doesn't hold him
back a little. But Mr. Basswood said he was anxious
to reach Rayville, and that's at least twenty
miles farther."</p>

<p>Ahead were several turns in the road, and at
these Dave lost sight of the car ahead. Being
cloudy, it was quite dark on the roadway, especially
where the trees lined the highway, and soon
Dave found it necessary to turn on the headlights.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>Then he sounded his horn, expecting to get a reply
from Ben, but to his surprise none came.</p>

<p>"Do you know what I think he's trying to do?"
said our hero, hastily. "I believe he's trying to
run away from us."</p>

<p>"It's a foolish thing to attempt, Dave, on a
strange road like this," answered Dunston Porter,
gravely. "I should think Mr. Basswood would
stop it."</p>

<p>Presently they were climbing a long hill. The
road wound in and out among the trees, and at one
place the grade was so steep that Dave had to
throw the clutch into low gear. He and his uncle
listened intently, and from a distance heard the
chug-chug of the other car a long way ahead.</p>

<p>"Say, this is some climb, believe me!" cried
Roger, as they made another turn, and Dave found
it advisable to come down to low gear.</p>

<p>"What will you do if you can't make it,
Dave?" queried Phil.</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll make it&mdash;don't worry," was the
answer. "I threw into low gear just for safety's
sake. This road twists so a fellow can't see fifty
feet ahead of him."</p>

<p>"I don't hear the other car any more," declared
Roger, a moment later.</p>

<p>To this Dave did not reply. There was another
turn ahead, and a particularly hard climb
over some rather rough rocks. Then, with a jolt,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>the big touring-car came out on the top of the hill.
Here was another turn, and then began a sharp
descent.</p>

<p>"Stop here a minute, Dave!" ordered the
youth's uncle, and then, as our hero brought the
machine to a standstill, he added: "That's
rather a bad road ahead, and you had better give
the other car a chance to get down before we try
to make it."</p>

<p>"A good idea, Uncle Dunston. We'll wait,"
answered Dave.</p>

<p>As they stood there all strained their ears to
catch some sound from the other car.</p>

<p>"I don't hear it at all," said Roger.</p>

<p>"All I hear is the breeze in the trees," put in
Laura.</p>

<p>"They must be running without power," answered
Dunston Porter.</p>

<p>"If they are going down a really steep hill, it's
a wonder we don't hear some squeak from the
brakes," was Phil's comment.</p>

<p>"Listen!" cried Dave, suddenly, and held up
his hand.</p>

<p>All strained their ears once more, and now far
below them they heard several cries mingled with
a shriek. Then came a sudden crash, followed by
more shrieks.</p>

<p>"They've had an accident!"</p>

<p>"Wonder what it was?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>"We'll have to go and see!" cried Dave, and
put on the power once more.</p>

<p>"That's right!" cried Dunston Porter: "Get
down there as fast as you can, Dave. But be careful&mdash;we
don't want to run into them, or have
any accident of our own. There must be something
wrong down there!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h2>ON THE ROAD</h2>
<br />

<p>"Perhaps they have gone off into some
ditch!"</p>

<p>"Maybe they bounced off a rock and hit a
tree!"</p>

<p>"A fellow could easily break a wheel on this
rough road!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope none of them have been hurt!"</p>

<p>Such were some of the remarks that came from
those in the tonneau of the touring-car, as Dave
put on the power and started down the winding
road which led to the bottom of the long hill.</p>

<p>"Better keep her in low gear, Dave," said
Dunston Porter, as the car struck a rather steep incline.
"The engine will help hold her back."</p>

<p>"I think I can hold her with the brakes, Uncle
Dunston," answered the youth, who had already
thrown off the power. He had the foot-brake
well down, and now he threw in the emergency as
well.</p>

<p>On and on slipped and slid the big touring-car,
bumping over a road which seemed to grow worse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>as they progressed. All of the lights were on full,
and they were needed, for the road turned and
twisted in such a fashion that but little could be
seen ahead. In some places the highway seemed
extra narrow, this being caused by the heavy trees
and bushes lining both sides. At one point the
water had caused quite a washout, and into this
and out again they bumped with such violence that
all the girls shrieked in alarm.</p>

<p>"Some bump that!" was Roger's grim comment.</p>

<p>"O dear, I thought sure I'd be jounced out!"
cried Jessie. "Dave, can't you go a little
slower?"</p>

<p>"I'll try," returned the youth, and jammed
down the foot-brake as hard as he could. For an
instant the touring-car came almost to a standstill,
but presently they slid onward again, coming a
moment later to another bend.</p>

<p>"Look out! Don't run into us!" It was a
yell from in front, and now Dave saw Luke Watson
standing in the roadway, waving his handkerchief.</p>

<p>Down in the darkness beyond Dave made out
the red, rear-light of the Basswood automobile.
As the second touring-car came on Luke leaped
to one side, but his warning had had its effect, and
now Dave jammed on both brakes with all the
force at his command, at the same time swerving
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>slightly to the left. He just grazed a trunk
strapped to the back of the first machine, and then
came to a halt on a water-break a short distance
beyond.</p>

<p>"Somebody get out and put a few stones under
the wheels!" cried Dave, who could not leave his
seat because of one foot on the brake.</p>

<p>"All right, we'll fix it!" cried his uncle, and
leaped out, followed quickly by the boys in the
tonneau of the car.</p>

<p>Loose stones were to be had in plenty, and soon
the car wheels were well blocked. Then Dave
was able to join those on the ground.</p>

<p>"Shall we get out?" asked Laura, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Suit yourselves," returned Dunston Porter,
who was already moving in the direction of the
other car.</p>

<p>The Wadsworth machine contained a hand
flashlight, and getting possession of this, Dave and
his chums hurried toward the other automobile.
They had already seen at a glance that the Basswood
touring-car had swung around to the side of
the road, and that one front wheel was held fast
between a large rock and a fair-sized tree. Apparently
the car was not hurt, and no one seemed
to be injured.</p>

<p>"How did it happen, Ben?" sang out Dave,
when he saw that the accident was not a serious
one.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>"Funniest thing you ever heard of," returned
his chum. "You couldn't possibly guess it."</p>

<p>"Didn't you slip on the rocks?" queried Phil.</p>

<p>"It was a cow put us here," said Mr. Basswood,
gravely. "Just a plain, every day, red
cow." And in spite of the accident his eyes had
a twinkle in them.</p>

<p>"A cow!" came from several of the others, in
wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes, a cow!" answered Ben, and his tone
showed his deep disgust. "I was going down the
hill just as nicely as you please when along came
a cow. A man was driving her, and when he saw
us coming he did his best to get the cow out of our
way. But that mooly didn't budge from the
middle of the road, so I had to turn to one side&mdash;and
this is the consequence."</p>

<p>"But I am so thankful that no one was hurt,"
broke in Mrs. Basswood. "Think of what might
have happened if the car had turned over!" and
she shuddered.</p>

<p>"But where is the cow?" questioned Roger.</p>

<p>"Oh, as soon as she had put us in this hole she
turned tail and ran down the hill as fast as she
could, and the man went after her," explained Mr.
Basswood.</p>

<p>"I guess the man ran away because he was
afraid we might hold him responsible for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>damages,"
remarked Shadow. "Say! this puts me in
mind of a story," he added. "One time a cow
got on the front piazza of a house, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"For gracious sake, Shadow! I guess you'd
want to tell stories at a funeral," burst out Ben.
"Never mind your yarn now. Let us see if we
can get this machine out from between this rock
and that tree."</p>

<p>"You didn't break the steering-gear, did
you?" asked Dave, anxiously, as he allowed the
flashlight to play over and around the touring-car.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I hurt anything, Dave. But
of course I can't be sure until I try to run the car,"
answered Ben. "What's worrying me is: How
am I going to get out of this fix? I don't believe
I can back out&mdash;in fact it wouldn't be safe."</p>

<p>"Looks to me as if we'd have to chop the tree
down to get out of here," commented Luke, who
had come back from where he had signaled the
other car.</p>

<p>"I think I see a way of aiding you," said Dunston
Porter, who was examining the rock that held
the wheel to the tree. "I think if we dig under
the edge of this rock, we can loosen it and roll it
down the hill. Then we'll be able to lift the
front of the automobile around&mdash;that is if we
can keep the machine from sliding down on us."</p>

<p>"We can easily fix that part of it," answered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Dave. "All we've got to do is to take that towing-rope
we brought along and fasten it to a tree
and the back axle of the car."</p>

<p>"That's the talk, Dave!" cried his uncle.
"Get the rope and make it fast at once."</p>

<p>While our hero and several of the other boys
were adjusting the towing-line which had been
brought along for emergencies, Dunston Porter
and Mr. Basswood set to work to loosen the rock
which held the wheel. This was no easy task, but
finally, with the aid of a hammer and a small crowbar,
it was accomplished, and the rock slid down
the roadway. Then the automobile began to start
forward.</p>

<p>"Look out there!" cried one of the boys.
"This line may not hold!"</p>

<p>"That will hold two cars like that," answered
Dave. The rope strained and creaked, but did
not break, and soon those in front of the car had
the machine jacked around once more in a straight
position, headed down the road.</p>

<p>"Now Ben, I guess you're all right again," said
Dave.</p>

<p>"Provided I don't meet that cow again," was
the retort. "How about that rope?"</p>

<p>"I'll unfasten it for you just as soon as you are
ready to start."</p>

<p>"I think I'd rather walk to the foot of the hill,"
remarked Mrs. Basswood, timorously.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>"Let us all walk down. I'll be glad of the exercise,"
cried Belle, who was tired of being
cramped up in the tonneau of the automobile.</p>

<p>"Oh, but maybe that cow will get after us,"
exclaimed Jessie.</p>

<p>"Pooh! who's afraid of a cow!" cried the western
girl, who had been brought up to face hundreds
of animals on her father's ranch.</p>

<p>"Well, I think we had better let the automobiles
go first, anyway," suggested Laura. "We don't
want them to come along and run over us," she
added, playfully.</p>

<p>Soon Ben and his chums were in the first of the
touring-cars. Dave released the rope, and the
automobile resumed the descent of the hill. Then
the towing-line was wound up and thrown into the
tonneau of the second car, and that also resumed
its journey.</p>

<p>Down at the foot of the long hill they met the
cow and her owner, a tall, cadaverous-looking individual,
who eyed our friends frowningly.</p>

<p>"I see you got your cow all right enough," remarked
Ben.</p>

<p>"So I did, but I'd a mighty long run to stop
her," growled the man.</p>

<p>"You put us in quite a hole; do you know
that?" went on Ben.</p>

<p>"'Tain't none of my fault," replied the owner
of the cow, quickly. "I have as much right on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>this road with my cow as you have with that there
autymobile."</p>

<p>"Just the same, you had no right to let your
cow keep to the middle of the road," cried Ben.
"If we had had a worse accident we might have
held you responsible."</p>

<p>"Huh! Hold me responsible, eh? Well ye
wouldn't have got a cent out of me," said the
owner of the cow, and then he passed on up the
hill once more, driving the animal before him.
The cow was contentedly chewing her cud, as if
nothing out of the ordinary had happened to disturb
her.</p>

<p>A quarter of a mile further on our friends came
to a small stream spanned by rather a shaky-looking
bridge, over which each machine was run with
great care. On the other side of the stream they
came to another fork of the road.</p>

<p>"Here's a signboard anyway!" cried Dave,
whose car was now in advance. "<i>'Rayville Four
Miles.</i>' We'll be there soon if this road holds
out."</p>

<p>"I think you'll find the roads around Rayville
all right," called Mr. Basswood to him. "My
friend told me that they were in good condition,
especially those on the other side of the town."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later found the two touring-cars
in the village where Mr. Basswood's
friend resided. Here, as the gentleman had said,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>was located a fairly good hotel, where accommodations
for the night could be had.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm going to go around and see my
friends," said Mr. Basswood. "Ben, you and
your chums can stay here at the hotel. We'll be
back before it's time to retire," and then he set off
in the touring-car, taking his wife with him.</p>

<p>As the hotel at Rayville made a specialty of
catering to automobile parties, our friends found
the accommodations there both ample and satisfactory.
After the hard run of the day, the girls
and the boys were glad to rest awhile. Then they
fixed up for dinner, which was served to them in a
private dining-room, apart from the other patrons
of the house. As might be expected, they had a
good deal of fun, and Shadow was allowed to tell
several of his stories, much to his own satisfaction
if not to that of his listeners.</p>

<p>"By this time to-morrow night we ought to be
at Bear Camp," said Dave, after they had finished
dinner and gone out on the hotel veranda to watch
what little was going on in the town.</p>

<p>"I guess it will be a good deal more lonely
than it is here, Dave," observed Jessie.</p>

<p>"There will be too many of us to be lonely," he
answered. "I'm looking forward to some
splendid times."</p>

<p>"Oh, so am I, Dave, and I am sure the others
hope to have good times, too."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>It was about ten o'clock when Mr. and Mrs.
Basswood came back to the hotel, having spent a
very pleasant evening with their friends, who had
wanted them to remain over night.</p>

<p>"I've got some news that I want to telegraph to
Crumville," announced Ben's father, as he came in.
"News that may interest Mr. Poole."</p>

<p>"What is that, Dad?" questioned his son, curiously.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Dobson spoke about a strange sort
of man who called on him yesterday. He thought
the man was out of his mind. He said the fellow
asked for work first, but then said he didn't care
whether he got a job or not, because he had to take
the night express for Sumatra."</p>

<p>"A strange man who wanted to take the night
express for Sumatra!" exclaimed Dave. "It
must have been 'The King of Sumatra'&mdash;Wilbur
Poole!"</p>

<p>"Just exactly what I think, Dave," answered
Mr. Basswood.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
<br />

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h2>CAUGHT IN A STORM</h2>
<br />

<p>"Did you ever know this Wilbur Poole, Dad?"
questioned Ben.</p>

<p>"Yes, I met him years ago at Aaron Poole's
home. But of course he was in his right mind
then. Poor chap! I pity him very much."</p>

<p>"I think we all pity him," answered Dave.
"Nobody can be responsible after his mind breaks
down."</p>

<p>"I feel sorry for Nat Poole and his folks," said
Laura. "This will give them a great deal of
trouble, not to mention the expense."</p>

<p>"If Wilbur Poole was anywhere around Rayville
it might pay to start a hunt for him," suggested
Roger.</p>

<p>"I don't think you'll find him anywhere around
here," answered Mr. Basswood. "But it won't
hurt to take a look around, if you boys care to take
a walk."</p>

<p>Ben's father went off to send his telegram to
Aaron Poole, and all the boys set off on a hunt
for the wild man. They covered the streets of the
village and some of the roads on the outskirts, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>without success. They met three people who had
talked to the strange individual, and from what
had passed Dave and his chums were sure that
the man must have been Wilbur Poole.</p>

<p>"I guess we'll have to give it up," said Phil,
when it was getting late. "I'm tired out. And
remember, fellows, we have a hard ride before us
to-morrow if we expect to reach Carpen Falls in
time to hit the trail for Bear Camp before it gets
dark."</p>

<p>When the boys reached the hotel the girls were
anxious to hear what they might have to tell.</p>

<p>"It's too bad," said Jessie, soberly. "I am
glad it is not one of my relatives who is roaming
around like that."</p>

<p>Both Dunston Porter and Mr. Basswood had
suggested an early start on the following morning,
so the entire party were downstairs and to breakfast
by seven o'clock. In the meantime the two
automobiles had been overhauled, and provided
with oil and gasoline, as well as with water.</p>

<p>"I've got rather a bad cut on one of the rear
wheels," said Ben. "Perhaps I had better change
the shoe before we start."</p>

<p>"Oh, take a chance on it!" cried Luke. "I
think you'll get through all right enough."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Luke; but if I don't, that blow-out
will cost me a fine inner tube. However, I'll take
the chance. Get in everybody, and we'll be off!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>As Mr. Basswood's friend had said, the road
leading from Rayville northwestward was in fine
shape, and they were able to cover the next thirty
miles at a fair rate of speed. But then they got in
among the hills, and here the road became as winding
and dangerous as ever.</p>

<p>Not knowing much about the stopping-places
ahead, the grown folks had had the hotel people
put up a substantial lunch for the tourists, packed
in two hampers.</p>

<p>"It will be jolly fun camping out this noon,"
said Laura. "It ought to just suit you, Belle."</p>

<p>"It certainly will!" was the answer from the
western girl. "I'd rather eat in the open than in
the stuffy dining-room of a hotel any time."</p>

<p>"There may be one drawback to having lunch
outdoors," said Phil. "It looks like rain."</p>

<p>"Phil, if you say rain again I'll throw you out
of the car!" cried Roger.</p>

<p>"I must admit it does look a little like rain,"
said Laura, casting her eyes skyward. "That's
an awfully black cloud over yonder. O dear, rain
would spoil it all! I do hope it holds off!"</p>

<p>Dave had been running the car, but now his
uncle insisted upon taking the wheel. Then Roger
climbed over onto the front seat, giving the one
he had been occupying beside Jessie to our hero.
They were in the lead, with the Basswood turnout
not far behind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>"This is more like," said Dave, in a low tone
to Jessie.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I suppose you had to do your share
in running the car, Dave," she replied, giving him a
bright look.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Uncle Dunston cares as much
for driving as he pretends," went on the youth.
"Behind it all, he is a good deal like Belle&mdash;he
prefers to be on horseback. He was brought up
to it."</p>

<p>"He has certainly been a great traveler, Dave."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed! And I would like to be just like
him. I'd love to travel."</p>

<p>"And where would you go if you had the
chance?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Maybe around the world,"
and Dave's eyes lit up as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Around the world! And would you go all
alone?"</p>

<p>"All alone? Not if I could get anybody to go
along with me! Wouldn't you like to take a trip
like that, Jessie?" and he gazed at her fondly.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave!"</p>

<p>"Well, it would be a great trip for both of us;
wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Dave, don't be silly," and Jessie blushed
deeply. "We are not going around the world yet,
we are going to Bear Camp, and that's plenty far
enough."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>"Yes, I know, Jessie. But you see"&mdash;and
Dave lowered his voice&mdash;"I want to make sure
that when I go you'll go with me. It will then be
the finest trip that ever anybody&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Bang! It was a report like that from a small
cannon, and came from close beside them. Jessie
gave a scream, and so did Laura and Mrs. Basswood,
while cries of wonder and alarm came from
the boys. The Basswood car had come up alongside
of the other automobile, and just at that instant
the tire which Ben had said was cut blew out,
sending a shower of dirt and stones in all directions.
Mr. Basswood, who was at the wheel,
brought the car to a quick stop, and Mr. Porter
also halted.</p>

<p>"Well, it went, just as I thought it might," remarked
Ben, grimly.</p>

<p>"Too bad!" returned Luke. "I reckon it was
my fault. I should have let you put on that other
shoe before we started."</p>

<p>"It's nobody's fault!" cried Mr. Basswood,
quickly. "Now then, boys, we'll see how soon we
can get another shoe on."</p>

<p>Many hands made the labor of jacking up the
car and changing the tire a light one. Fortunately
the automobile was equipped with a pump attached
to the engine, so that blowing up the tire by hand
was unnecessary.</p>

<p>"This is only a little exercise to get up an <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>appetite
for that lunch," remarked Dave, gaily. "We
want to do full justice to the stuff in the hamper."</p>

<p>"As if there was ever anything the matter with
your appetite!" cried Phil, dryly.</p>

<p>"Why Philip, my son, you know I never eat
more than a bird!" retorted Dave, with a twinkle
in his eye.</p>

<p>"Humph! A bird, eh? I guess you must
mean an ostrich," retorted the shipowner's son,
and at this sally there was a general laugh in which
even Dave joined.</p>

<p>"Just eleven o'clock," remarked Luke, consulting
his watch. "When do we stop for that
lunch?"</p>

<p>"At twelve o'clock precisely," answered Mrs.
Basswood. "That is, of course, if we happen to
be in the right kind of a place. We don't want to
stop just anywhere."</p>

<p>"Might eat the lunch while we were running,"
suggested Roger. "It would make it last so
much longer."</p>

<p>"Wow! What a joke!" cried Phil.</p>

<p>"Say, that puts me in mind of a story!" burst
out Shadow. "A fellow named William took his
best girl for a trip by train to another town, and on
the way they went into the dining-car for lunch.
He said afterwards that it was the longest lunch
he had ever eaten, and as the girl had ordered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>nearly everything on the bill of fare it was also the
longest bill he had ever paid."</p>

<p>"A long bill but a short story, Shadow!" cried
Luke.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know one thing, Shadow," observed
Dave. "Was it William who paid the bill or was
it Bill who had to put up several Williams to pay
for it?"</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Dave! What are you talking
about?" queried his sister, with a puzzled look
on her face.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's easy, Laura," answered Roger.
"William&mdash;Bill, Bill&mdash;William. Don't you
see the joke?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course! How thick I am!" returned
the girl, quickly.</p>

<p>Soon they were once more on the way. They
had a long hill to ascend, the road winding in and
out among the trees and around the rocks. It was
a hard pull, and several times they had to change
to second gear and even to low.</p>

<p>"O my, what a beautiful view!" cried Belle,
when the top of the hill was gained. And in her
excitement she stood straight up in the automobile
to look around her.</p>

<p>"It certainly is beautiful," returned Jessie.
"One can see for miles and miles in every direction!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>"Oh, Mrs. Basswood, don't you think this
would be a lovely place to have lunch?" cried
Laura.</p>

<p>At the mention of lunch, Luke, Shadow, and
Phil brought out their watches simultaneously.</p>

<p>"Seventeen minutes of twelve," announced the
shipowner's son.</p>

<p>"I've got quarter of," cried Luke.</p>

<p>"You must both be off," put in Shadow. "I'm
only fourteen minutes and a half of twelve," he
announced, gravely. "Have we got to wait till
twelve o'clock?" he continued, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I guess it'll be twelve o'clock before we get
anything to eat," answered Mrs. Basswood, with a
smile. "I think this would be just an ideal spot to
rest."</p>

<p>"Oh, we've just got to stay here for a while,
whether we eat or not!" cried Belle. "I'm going
to get out and run up on to the rocks over there,"
and suiting the action to the words, she leaped out
of the automobile and started to make her way to
the spot she had indicated.</p>

<p>"Look out that you don't fall over into the
hollow," cautioned Dave, as he assisted Jessie and
his sister to alight.</p>

<p>To one side of the roadway was something of a
cleared space, and into this the two automobiles
were run. The boys got out the hampers and
other things, and took them over to the spot which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>Belle's quick eyes had picked out. Here there
was a patch of green grass shaded by several large
trees, and in front of it a flat rock, beyond which
was spread out a vast panorama of hills and valleys
stretching for many miles.</p>

<p>"It's a perfect picture!" cried Jessie. "I must
get a photograph of it."</p>

<p>"Yes. And we must take a photograph of the
crowd at lunch," returned Dave.</p>

<p>"Let's eat before we start to take any photographs,"
put in Luke, who seemed to be extra
hungry. "I never did look well in a picture taken
before eating," and at this there was a general
laugh.</p>

<p>While the boys brought the various things from
the cars, the girls and Mrs. Basswood spread a
lunch-cloth partly on the grass and partly on the
flat rock, and on this placed the various good
things which had been brought along.</p>

<p>"First call for lunch!" sang out Dave, loudly,
when all was in readiness.</p>

<p>"I guess your first call will be the last, too,
Dave!" exclaimed Jessie. "Here! what will you
have&mdash;a ham sandwich or one with chicken?"</p>

<p>"I think I'll try the chicken," he answered.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be backward about coming forward,
Dave!" cried Luke. "Why don't you try them
both?"</p>

<p>"I will before I get through."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>"We all will," declared Roger. "There is
nothing the matter with this air for giving one an
appetite," he added. "I believe after we have
been up at Bear Camp for a while we'll all be
eating like wolves."</p>

<p>"Why not like bears, if we are going to Bear
Camp?" suggested Phil.</p>

<p>"Say, I can't bear a joke like that!" broke in
Roger.</p>

<p>"It was a little barefaced; wasn't it?" commented
Dave.</p>

<p>"Oh, quit your joking, I'm hungry," pleaded
Luke. And then all the young folks fell to eating
with great gusto, and it must be admitted that
the older heads followed suit.</p>

<p>The lunch lasted the best part of half an hour,
and was thoroughly enjoyed by every one. Then
the young people got out their cameras, and various
snap-shots and time-pictures were taken, to be
developed and printed later on.</p>

<p>"Now then, let us pack up as quickly as we can,
and finish this trip," said Mr. Basswood, presently.</p>

<p>As he spoke he looked up at the sky, and the
others did the same. Off to the westward they
saw a number of black clouds rolling up rapidly.</p>

<p>"Say, Dave, that looks like a real storm to
me," remarked Roger, anxiously. "What do
you think of it?"</p>

<p>"It's a storm, all right," was the answer.
"And if we don't catch it before we reach the end
of our journey we'll be lucky."</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>As quickly as possible, the various things were
packed up and placed in the two touring-cars.
Then they started off once more, with Mr. Porter
and Mr. Basswood at the steering wheels. They
had covered less than five miles when they heard
a rushing of wind through the woods. It seemed
to come by fits and starts, but steadily increased in
volume. The sky grew darker, and soon some
large drops of rain fell.</p>

<p>"We'll have to put up the tops!" cried Dave.</p>

<p>The Basswood car had already come to a stop
and those in it were hurrying to put up the top.
As Dave unfastened the straps on the Wadsworth
automobile, the drops of rain came down faster
than ever.</p>

<p>"We didn't get that up any too soon," remarked
the boy's uncle, when the job was finished.</p>

<p>"Hadn't I better put up the side curtains,
too?" queried Dave.</p>

<p>"You'll have to put up everything you've got,
Dave!" cried Roger. "Just look at what's coming!"</p>

<p>There was no need to look, for already the
rain was driving in on them. Working with all
possible speed, the boys soon adjusted the curtains.</p>

<p>"Uncle Dunston, we can't run without chains
if the road gets wet," cried Dave.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>"I am going to run under yonder trees. We
can put the chains on there," answered Dunston
Porter, and they started forward once again, with
the rain pelting down upon them furiously.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h2>FROM ONE HARDSHIP TO ANOTHER</h2>
<br />

<p>"I guess I was right about the rain," remarked
Phil, grimly, as the drops pattered unceasingly on
the cover of the automobile.</p>

<p>"You sure were, Phil!" cried Belle. "It's
coming down just as hard as ever it can."</p>

<p>"If only the wind would stop blowing!" said
Jessie. "Do you think there is any danger of
our being blown over?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't as bad as all that," answered Dave.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mr. Porter espied a suitable
place under several large trees, and here he
brought the touring-car to a standstill. Then the
Basswood car come close alongside.</p>

<p>"Going to put on the chains?" called out Mr.
Basswood, to make himself heard above the noise
of the elements.</p>

<p>"I think we had better," returned Dave's
uncle. "I imagine we've quite a hill to descend
a little farther on."</p>

<p>There were raincoats in each touring-car, and
these were now donned by Dave and his uncle,
and by Ben and his father. Then the chains for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>the back wheels for both automobiles were
brought forth.</p>

<p>Even under the thick foliage of the trees the
rain was coming down, although of course not
nearly as hard as on the roadway beyond. The
chains were straightened out on the grass, and
each automobile was backed up a little so that the
articles might be fastened on. The task took but
a few minutes, and then those who had accomplished
it got back into the machines.</p>

<p>"I'll lead the way," called out Mr. Porter.
"You had better not follow me too closely."</p>

<p>"Very well, I'll watch out," answered Mr.
Basswood.</p>

<p>"Uncle Dunston, don't you want to let me
drive?" queried Dave. "I've had a little more
experience at it than you have had."</p>

<p>"I can do it, Dave," was the reply. "But, at
the same time, if you think it would be safer, take
the wheel. I must own up that I'd rather be on
a horse or behind one than steering a car like this
in such a storm."</p>

<p>Dave squeezed himself into the driver's seat,
and a moment later they were off again over the
plateau of the hill, and then down the other side.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing as furiously as ever, and
now from a distance came the low rumble of
thunder.</p>

<p>"O dear! What is that?" cried Laura.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>"I guess it was thunder, but I don't think it
will amount to anything," returned Roger.</p>

<p>The bottom of the hill gained, they traversed
a narrow valley for a distance of seven or eight
miles. Then came another climb over a winding
highway, which at certain points was filled with
loose stones and dirt.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Dave. We don't want to do any
skidding," cautioned the youth's uncle.</p>

<p>"I'm watching out all I can," was the grim
reply. Dave was bending over the steering-wheel,
trying his best to see through the windshield. "I
guess I'll have to open it a little," he went on,
nodding in the direction of the glass.</p>

<p>"I'll do it for you," answered Dunston Porter,
and threw out the upper side of the shield.</p>

<p>By this means Dave was able to get a clear
vision of the roadway directly in front of the machine.
But the opening of the windshield let in
considerable of the driving rain.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, you'll get wet from the knees
down!" cried Jessie, solicitously.</p>

<p>"Can't help it," he replied. "I can't see with
the windshield closed."</p>

<p>The rumblings of thunder had increased, and
now from over a distant hill came various streaks
of lightning. The sky was much darker, and in
order to see better, Dave turned on the electric
lights. Looking back, those in the tonneau of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>forward car saw that the Basswood machine was
also lighted. By the time the top of the next hill
was gained, a distance of fully a mile, the thunderstorm
was on them in all its fury. The wind tore
through the woods, sending leaves and small
branches flying in all directions. From the north
and the west came vivid flashes of lightning, followed
by sharp claps of thunder, which rolled and
rumbled across the hills and mountains.</p>

<p>"O dear, if we only had some place to stop!"
cried Jessie, timorously.</p>

<p>"There isn't any sort of a building in sight,"
replied Dunston Porter, who had been looking on
all sides for some time. "If there was I'd have
Dave head for it pretty quick."</p>

<p>"According to the map we ought to be within
a few miles of Simpson's Corners," said Roger.
"How about it, Dave?"</p>

<p>"Just what I was thinking," answered our hero.
"I was wondering if it wasn't on the other side of
the next rise."</p>

<p>They were running along another small valley,
at the end of which was a sharp turn to the left
and a rise of several hundred feet. Here the
downfall of rain had flooded the road for a considerable
distance. Coming to this place Dave
had to slow down, but he still kept on some
power, not wishing to get stuck.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>"Can you make it, Dave?" asked his uncle,
anxiously, as the chains of the automobile ground
deeply into the mud and loose stones.</p>

<p>"We've got to make it, Uncle Dunston!" cried
the boy, grimly.</p>

<p>The car proceeded more and more slowly even
with the power turned on. Dave had been running
in second gear, but now he came down to low.
Mud and stones flew in all directions, while the
water was splashed out on both sides as if coming
from geysers. Then, with one last effort, the
automobile left the level roadway and started up
the hill beyond.</p>

<p>The Wadsworth car was almost at the top of
the rise when a turn in the road enabled its occupants
to see the second car.</p>

<p>"Look!" burst out Roger. "I do believe
they're stuck!"</p>

<p>"Stuck! Do you mean in that wet place?"
asked Dave, quickly.</p>

<p>"That's it," put in Phil. "They are stuck just
as sure as you're born!" he added, a second later.</p>

<p>The forward car had now reached a spot on
the side of the hill which was comparatively level,
so that Dave had no trouble in coming to a halt.
It was still raining as furiously as ever, and the
thunder and lightning were just as incessant.
Looking down on the wet portion of the road <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>below
them, they saw that the Basswood car was
standing still, with water and mud half way up to
the hubs.</p>

<p>"He has shut off the power! That's no way
to do!" cried Dave. "He ought to keep his
engine going, and either try to go forward or backward.
If he stands still he will sink deeper than
ever."</p>

<p>"He's trying to back now, Dave," returned
Phil, and he was right.</p>

<p>Soon they saw the wheels of the Basswood car
revolving rapidly, and the turnout itself moved
slowly to the rear. Then Ben must have reversed
the power, for the car came forward, but this time
headed for the left side of the road.</p>

<p>"I don't think he'll gain much by that move,"
observed Dave. "I tried it, and found it rather
soft over there."</p>

<p>"Look, he is backing again!" cried Laura.
"O dear! Whatever will he do if he gets stuck
fast?"</p>

<p>"Let us hope that nothing like that happens,"
answered her uncle, gravely.</p>

<p>But that was just what did happen, and although
both Ben and his father did their best to free the
car from the mud, it was without avail. They
managed to get to within fifteen feet of the end
of the wet place, and there they stayed, unable to
budge either forward or backward.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>"Listen! he is sounding his horn!" cried
Roger, during a brief lull in the storm.</p>

<p>"I guess he wants us to come back and help
pull him out," answered Dave, and sounded a reply
to show that he had heard the call of distress.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Dave&mdash;try to
turn around here or back down?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's too narrow to turn here!" cried
Laura, in alarm.</p>

<p>"You'll have us all over in the ditch if you
don't look out!" came from one of the others in
the car.</p>

<p>"I see a little wider spot further ahead," answered
Dave, and turned on the power once more.</p>

<p>Soon he had reached the place in question, and
there, by skillful maneuvering, he managed to turn
the touring-car the other way. Then he came
down the hill slowly until within a few feet of the
bad spot in the highway.</p>

<p>"Hello there!" called out Mr. Basswood.
"I guess you'll have to get out that towing-rope
again and give us a lift."</p>

<p>"Just what I thought," answered Dave.
"We'll have it out in a jiffy."</p>

<p>He and his uncle alighted once more, taking
with them the towing-rope that had been used before.
Mr. Basswood was already out of the car,
standing in water and mud over his shoe-tops.</p>

<p>"Here, catch the rope!" called out our hero,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>and sent one end whirling toward the other car in
true cowboy fashion&mdash;a trick he had learned
while staying at Star Ranch.</p>

<p>Mr. Basswood caught the rope, and soon had
it adjusted to the front axle of the car. In the
meanwhile Dave and his uncle fastened the other
end to the rear axle of their own turnout.</p>

<p>"Now then, turn on your power when I sound
my horn," directed Dave.</p>

<p>"Right you are!" yelled back Ben, who was at
the wheel.</p>

<p>Mr. Porter remained on the ground to watch
proceedings, while Dave re-entered the Wadsworth
machine and turned on the power. Then
our hero sounded the horn and began to advance.
The towing-rope strained and cracked, and threatened
for a moment to snap. Slowly the Wadsworth
car went ahead inch by inch. The rear
wheels of the Basswood machine churned the
water and mud furiously.</p>

<p>"Say! we don't seem to be getting out of this
very fast," remarked Shadow, who was in the
rear car beside Mrs. Basswood.</p>

<p>"Put on all your power, Ben. It's the only
thing you can do," ordered the lad's father.</p>

<p>The rear wheels of the second machine ground
deeper into the mud and loose stones, throwing
them and the water up into the air and even onto
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>the cover of the machine. The towing-rope continued
to creak ominously.</p>

<p>"Be on guard, everybody, if that rope breaks!"
cried Mr. Basswood, warningly. He knew that
if the towing-line parted near one end or the other
there was grave danger of the flying rope coming
back to damage one of the machines.</p>

<p>Inch by inch the second car moved forward.
Dave had not dared to turn on all power, fearing
to snap the towing-line, but now, as the second
machine gained a little headway, he added power
steadily.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! Here we come!" shouted Luke,
in a tone of relief. And a few seconds later the
Basswood car rolled out of the water and mud to
the comparatively dry roadway ahead.</p>

<p>"Say, that was some stunt&mdash;to get out of
there!" was Shadow's comment.</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad the other car was here to
help us," answered Ben. "If it hadn't been
here I guess we would have stayed there for a
while," he added, grimly.</p>

<p>"I think both our cars will need washing after
this trip," observed Dave, with a grin, as he coiled
up the towing-line once more and stowed it away.</p>

<p>"This sure is some ending to this trip!" observed
Ben, making a wry face.</p>

<p>"We haven't seen the end of it yet, Ben," <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>answered
Dunston Porter. "There may be worse
roads than this ahead. I don't believe they are
very good around Carpen Falls."</p>

<p>With the rain pelting down unceasingly, the two
cars proceeded on the journey. The thunder and
lightning had let up a little, but now, as the top
of the next hill was gained, it seemed to become
more violent than before.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is dreadful!" cried Jessie, as a particularly
bright flash lit up the interior of the automobile.
"What if we should be struck!"</p>

<p>"Let us hope that nothing like that happens!"
answered Laura. Her face, too, showed her
alarm.</p>

<p>"I think I saw some sort of a village ahead,"
cried Dave, who had been peering intently through
the windshield. "I think I saw the white steeple
of a church."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's Simpson's Corners," suggested
Belle.</p>

<p>"I hope there is a hotel there and a garage,"
said Dunston Porter. "We'll want to have a
chance to dry ourselves and get supper."</p>

<p>"Then you don't think we'll reach Carpen Falls
to-night?" questioned Phil.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think, Phil. Perhaps
we may&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Porter did not finish what he was saying.
Just at that instant came a vivid flash of lightning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>that nearly blinded them. It was followed by an
ear-splitting crash of thunder. Then came another
crash closer by, and an instant later Dave
and his uncle saw a large tree fall directly toward
the roadway in front of them!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h2>A STROKE OF LIGHTNING</h2>
<br />

<p>"Look out!"</p>

<p>"We are going into that tree!"</p>

<p>"Jam on both brakes, Dave, just as hard as
you can!" cried Dunston Porter.</p>

<p>Even before his uncle had spoken Dave had
pressed down both feet hard, thus putting on the
foot-brake and releasing the gear-clutch. Now
his hand shot over to the emergency brake, and
this came up with all the power at his command.
But the grade was downward, and the road slippery
from the rain, and instead of stopping, the
touring-car went on, sliding through the mud and
over the rocks until it was practically on top of
the tree. Then came a jar that threw everybody
forward. The steering-wheel saved Dave, but
his uncle's elbow struck the windshield, cracking
it in several places.</p>

<p>"Look, we've run into a tree!"</p>

<p>"Did the lightning hit the machine?"</p>

<p>"Say, Roger, take yourself off my feet; will
you?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>This last cry came from Phil, who was huddled
up in a corner of the tonneau.</p>

<p>"It isn't me, it's the handbag, Phil," gasped
out Roger, who hung partly over the front seat
of the touring-car.</p>

<p>"Anybody hurt?" questioned Dunston Porter
quickly, as soon as the shock had come to an end.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;think I am all right, Uncle Dunston,"
panted Laura. "But dear me! wasn't it
awful?"</p>

<p>"I thought I was going to fly right over Dave's
head," wailed Jessie, who had come up behind the
youth with a great thump. "Oh, Dave, did I
hurt you?"</p>

<p>"Knocked a little of the wind out of me, Jessie;
that's all," he answered. "But I won't mind that
if only you are not hurt."</p>

<p>"Say, that was some stop, believe me!" was
Phil's grim comment, as he managed to straighten
up and look ahead. "Stuffed mackerel! what
did we try to do, Dave&mdash;climb a tree?"</p>

<p>"No. We tried to take a running jump and
go over it," replied Roger, with a faint attempt
at humor.</p>

<p>"Sound the horn, Dave, as loudly as you can!"
cried his uncle, quickly. "We must warn the
others." And thus admonished, Dave put his
finger on the button of the electric horn and held
it down for some time. Looking backward, those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>in the Wadsworth car soon saw the Basswood
machine come into sight and then slow down.
The heavy clap of thunder was now followed by
another fierce downfall of rain, while the sky grew
blacker than ever. In the midst of this outburst
the second touring-car came slowly forward.</p>

<p>"Did the lightning strike you?" yelled Ben.</p>

<p>"No. But we had a close call of it," answered
Mr. Porter. "It hit this tree when we were less
than one hundred and fifty feet away. Then the
tree came down as you see, and we ploughed right
into it."</p>

<p>"Phew! That's some escape!" was Mr. Basswood's
comment. "Anything broken?"</p>

<p>"We don't know yet," answered Dave.</p>

<p>He alighted from the car, and his uncle did likewise.
An examination showed that one of the
mudguards in front had been badly bent, and that
a headlight had snapped off, but beyond this,
and the windshield, the big touring-car seemed to
be undamaged.</p>

<p>"I'm thankful it's no worse," remarked Dunston
Porter.</p>

<p>"It's too bad the light had to go," returned
Dave. "It will make running at night rather
dangerous until we can get it fixed."</p>

<p>"Oh, let us be thankful that no one was hurt!"
cried Laura.</p>

<p>While Dave and his uncle had been examining
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>the car, Mr. Basswood and the others had been
looking for some way around the tree, which covered
the roadway completely.</p>

<p>"I think I see a path through yonder trees,"
said Ben, pointing to his left. "The ground
seems to be pretty good there, and I think the
opening is plenty large enough for our cars."</p>

<p>Mr. Basswood moved forward in the direction
his son indicated, and soon called to Ben to start
the car. He led the way on foot, and the machine
followed slowly. They passed in and out among
several trees, and then emerged once more on the
highway, some distance beyond the obstruction.</p>

<p>"Hurrah! That's the way to do it!" cried
Luke. "Now the others can back up and follow
us."</p>

<p>"So they can," answered Shadow. "But what
about leaving that tree in the roadway? It's
mighty dangerous, and will be more so after
dark."</p>

<p>"We can notify the authorities at Simpson's
Corners," said Mr. Basswood. "They can send
somebody up here with a lantern."</p>

<p>He went back to tell the others of what had
been accomplished, and soon the Wadsworth car
was backed out from between the branches of the
tree that shut off the highway.</p>

<p>"Well, I think the rain is letting up a little,
anyway," announced Roger, after the two <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>touring-cars
were once more under way. And he was
right. That last downfall seemed to clear the
sky, and soon they saw the clouds scattering.</p>

<p>Wet from end to end, and covered with mud,
the two automobiles rolled into the little settlement
that went by the name of Simpson's Corners.
Here an old man named Simpson kept a general
store to which, in the rear, was attached a small
livery stable and garage.</p>

<p>"You certainly must have had some trip over
the hills in this storm," remarked Mr. Simpson,
after the party had trooped into his place. "It's
about as heavy a rainfall as we have had in some
time. Where are you bound?"</p>

<p>"We wanted to get to Carpen Falls if we
could," answered Dunston Porter. "But perhaps
we'll stay in Simpson's Corners, if there are
any accommodations."</p>

<p>"Ain't no hotel here," answered the storekeeper.
"Used to be one some years ago, but it
didn't pay, so the feller that run it gave it up.
But Mrs. Whittle serves lunch to travelers if you
are hungry."</p>

<p>"Me for Mrs. Whittle's!" whispered Phil.</p>

<p>"Good gracious, Phil! You seem to be hungry
all the time on this trip," was Belle's good-natured
comment.</p>

<p>"Maybe if we stay here an hour or two it will
clear off," said Dave, who was examining the sky
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>closely. "I think the storm is shifting very rapidly."</p>

<p>"I believe you're right, Dave," answered his
uncle. "Yes, we'll stay here and get dried out a
little, if nothing else."</p>

<p>It was learned that Mrs. Whittle's place was
just across the street, and the lady said she would
be very glad to furnish them with a hot supper,
and added that they could come in and dry themselves
in her sitting-room, where she started an
open fire. The machines were placed in Mr.
Simpson's garage, and they purchased from the
storekeeper some gasoline and oil.</p>

<p>"Only a little after five o'clock," announced
Roger. "I think by six o'clock the storm will
be over," he added.</p>

<p>While they were eating the supper provided by
Mrs. Whittle, it stopped raining, and a little later
they saw the setting sun over the hills to the westward.</p>

<p>"How many miles is it to Carpen Falls from
here?" asked Luke.</p>

<p>"Fourteen by the automobile blue book," answered
Dave.</p>

<p>"And what of the road?" questioned Ben.</p>

<p>"Mr. Simpson said it wasn't so bad but that it
might be worse," answered Dunston Porter, who
had been interviewing the storekeeper and who
had told the man about the fallen tree, having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>learned that Mr. Simpson was the head of the
township committee.</p>

<p>"We don't want to get stuck, especially after
it gets dark," said Ben.</p>

<p>"I wish we could stay here," sighed Mrs. Basswood.
"But there don't seem to be any accommodations."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll get through; come ahead!" cried
Dave. "If we don't reach Carpen Falls to-night
Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth will worry about us."</p>

<p>Feeling in somewhat better spirits after having
eaten, and after having had an opportunity to dry
themselves, the tourists brought out their automobiles
again, and soon Simpson's Corners was left
behind. They had a long hill to climb, and then
the road wound in and out among some particularly
rough rocks. Then they came out along the
edge of a cliff with a vast panorama of woods and
waters below them.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it perfectly lovely!" cried Belle.</p>

<p>"If I'm not mistaken, Mirror Lake lies off in
that direction," said Dunston Porter, pointing
with his hand. "That sheet of water away off
yonder may be it."</p>

<p>Leaving the cliff, the road wound in and out
of the forest for a distance of several miles.
Then they came to another little valley, in which
the highway was wet and, in some spots, suspiciously
spongy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>"Now then, Dave, be careful," warned his
uncle. "We don't want to get stuck if we can
possibly help it."</p>

<p>"I'll do my best, Uncle Dunston," was the
answer.</p>

<p>With the wheels sucking and sousing in the
mud, the Wadsworth machine moved forward as
rapidly as the conditions would permit. Close
behind was the Basswood car, and this time Ben
took care not to let the engine slow down too
much. Once Dave was afraid that he was going
to be stuck, but in a few seconds the danger was
past, and in two minutes more they were out on
the solid roadway once more.</p>

<p>"We are coming to some sort of a settlement!"
cried Mr. Porter, after several miles more had
been covered. "See, there it is&mdash;right down at
the foot of this hill!"</p>

<p>"It must be Carpen Falls," announced Dave.
"See, there are the Falls off to the right!" and
he pointed to where a fair-sized stream of water
came down between the trees and fell over the
rocks. The Falls were fifteen to twenty feet
high, and made a beautiful sight.</p>

<p>Carpen Falls was a settlement of some importance,
for the campers on the lakes for miles
around came there to do their trading. There
were two general stores, one containing the post-office,
and also a blacksmith's shop, livery stable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>and garage combined, and a small summer hotel.</p>

<p>"Oh, look! My father and mother!" cried
Jessie, as the two machines rolled up to the hotel.</p>

<p>To the surprise of all, Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth
stood on the piazza watching their approach.</p>

<p>"Oh, we thought you would never get here!"
cried Mrs. Wadsworth, in relief. "We thought
sure you had had some sort of accident on the
road."</p>

<p>"And how is it you are here?" asked Dave,
quickly.</p>

<p>"We came in this morning to do some trading
at the store," answered Mr. Wadsworth. "We
were going back, when it began to storm so hard
that we decided to stay here until the rain let up,
and until you arrived. It certainly was a hard
downpour!"</p>

<p>"We came pretty near having several accidents,"
answered Ben. And then after the party
had alighted, they told of the various happenings
on the journey.</p>

<p>"We can remain here all night if you want to,"
announced the jewelry manufacturer. "But if you
would rather go on to the bungalows I think we
can make it. There are two old stages here, and
the drivers are perfectly willing to make the trip."</p>

<p>"Now we have gotten so far, let us finish the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>trip," urged Laura. "I think I would rather be
at the bungalows than at this hotel," she added,
with a look around that hostelry&mdash;a place that
was not particularly inviting.</p>

<p>"But you'll want supper first; won't you?"
questioned Mrs. Wadsworth.</p>

<p>"We had something to eat at Simpson's Corners,"
answered her daughter.</p>

<p>The stages that Mr. Wadsworth had mentioned
were certainly old-fashioned and dilapidated,
but each was drawn by a pair of sturdy
horses, and the drivers said that they were perfectly
safe and could make the journey to Mirror
Lake without trouble. So, having transferred the
baggage from the automobiles to these ancient
vehicles, and having placed the touring-cars in the
garage, with orders to have the damaged car repaired,
our friends piled into the turnouts, and
then, with various calls to the animals and loud
crackings of the whips, the two stages started for
Bear Camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h2>AT BEAR CAMP</h2>
<br />

<p>"Talk about the old-time coaching days!"
remarked Dave. "I don't believe they were any
worse than this."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, you mustn't find fault!" cried Jessie.
"We'll soon be there, I hope."</p>

<p>"Providing we don't go down in some hole and
break off a wheel," put in Roger. "Say, this
road is some rough!"</p>

<p>"I'll have it rolled down for you the next time,
Roger!" cried Phil, gaily. "Just imagine yourself
in the wild West, in one of the old-time overland
coaches, with the Indians in full pursuit.
How about that, Belle?"</p>

<p>"It sounds good enough for a dime novel,"
answered the girl from the West. "Personally
I never saw any Indians in pursuit of a stage-coach
or anything else. The Indians around Star
Ranch were as peaceable as one could wish."</p>

<p>Over the rough and rather narrow trail bumped
the two stage-coaches. Our friends frequently
found themselves bounced off the seats, and more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>than once they were in danger of cracking their
heads against the roofs of the turnouts. It was
growing dark, and the only lights the drivers had
were their smoking lanterns. Inside of the stage-coaches
the boys had their hand flashlights, which
they used occasionally to illuminate the scene.</p>

<p>"Never mind! Don't you care!" cried Phil,
and then added: "What's the matter with a
song?"</p>

<p>"Let's give them our old Oak Hall song!"
exclaimed Dave, and a moment later he started
their old favorite, sung to the tune of "Auld
Lang Syne."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oak Hall we never shall forget,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No matter where we roam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is the very best of schools,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To us it's just like home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then give three cheers, and let them ring<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Throughout this world so wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To let the people know that we<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Elect to here abide!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Oh, how splendid!" was Belle's comment.
"Please sing it again," and they did.</p>

<p>Then they followed with a number of familiar
songs. The sound was caught up by those in the
second coach, and soon they too were singing
lustily.</p>

<p>"Gosh-all-hemlock!" was the comment of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>stage-driver of the forward coach. "That there
singin' is better'n a nigger minstrels!"</p>

<p>"Better join in," suggested Dave, and then
started up with "The Suwanee River," and to the
surprise of all the old stage-driver broke in with
a heavy bass voice which really balanced the others
quite well.</p>

<p>The storm was a thing of the past, and as night
came on the thin crescent of the new moon and
numberless stars showed themselves.</p>

<p>"O my, look!"</p>

<p>"Isn't that perfectly grand!"</p>

<p>"I don't wonder they call it Mirror Lake!"</p>

<p>Such were some of the cries from the girls as
the first of the stage-coaches rolled out on the
edge of the sheet of water by which the bungalows
were located. Here, at a certain point, they
could gaze down the full length of the lake. In
spite of the rain that had fallen the surface of
the water seemed unusually smooth, and it glistened
in the light of the moon and the stars like
silver.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's just too splendid for anything!"
exclaimed Jessie, as she clapped her hands in delight.
"What a beautiful place to come to!"</p>

<p>"I don't see how it could be any prettier than
it is," added Laura.</p>

<p>"Why, it's just like a scene from fairyland!"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>declared Belle. "Oh, I know I'm going to have
just the nicest time ever while I'm here!"</p>

<p>"I see the bungalows!" cried Roger, and he
pointed to a number of lights twinkling between
the trees.</p>

<p>"I told Mary, the hired girl, to light up so we
could see where we were going," said Mrs. Wadsworth.</p>

<p>"This is about as far as we can go with the
stages," announced the driver of the first turnout,
as he came to a halt. "You'll have to walk the
rest of the distance. Bill and me will help you
with the traps."</p>

<p>Soon the other stage came up, and all on board
alighted. The two stage-drivers took the heaviest
of the suitcases, while the boys and Mr. Porter
and Mr. Basswood carried the others. Mr. and
Mrs. Wadsworth led the way along a trail that
was still somewhat wet and slippery.</p>

<p>"It's right in the woods, that's sure!" declared
Roger.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" asked Dave, as
they approached the two bungalows, which stood
only a short distance apart.</p>

<p>"Oh, I like it very much. I think we ought
to have a dandy time here, Dave."</p>

<p>"Just what I was thinking."</p>

<p>Their approach had been noticed by the servant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>girls, and this couple came out to meet them.
Then the two drivers were paid, and they returned
to their stages and started back for Carpen Falls.</p>

<p>"I'm glad that journey is ended!" remarked
Jessie, as she sank into a rustic rocking-chair.
"My! but it was quite an adventure; now wasn't
it?"</p>

<p>"It certainly was, Jessie," answered Dave. "I
don't suppose you'll want to go back by automobile?"</p>

<p>"Not unless you guarantee the weather, Dave,"
she answered, with a smile.</p>

<p>The Basswood family, along with Shadow and
Luke, had gone off to the second bungalow, leaving
the others at the one over which Mrs. Wadsworth
was to preside. The lady of the bungalow
showed the girls and the boys the various rooms
which they were to occupy. As all of the other
baggage had arrived from the railroad station
two days before, the tourists lost no time in getting
rid of their damp garments and donning
others more comfortable. After that all made
an inspection of the bungalow, and then trooped
over to the other building.</p>

<p>"Say, this suits me down to the ground!" said
Luke. "It couldn't be better."</p>

<p>"I noticed a number of canoes and rowboats at
the dock," said Shadow. "We are bound to
have some fine times out on that lake."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>"And did you notice the bath-houses?" added
Ben. "That means good times swimming."</p>

<p>"Providing the water isn't too cold," said Phil.
"In some of these lakes among the mountains it
gets pretty cold, don't you know, especially if the
lake happens to be fed by springs."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! who's afraid of a little cold water?"
cried his chum, disdainfully.</p>

<p>"Any danger of a bear coming to eat us up?"
queried Luke.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say bears again!" cried Jessie.
"I don't want to hear of them, much less see
them."</p>

<p>"Say, that puts me in mind of a story!" cried
Shadow, eagerly. "Once a bear got away from
his keeper and wandered around a little New
England village until he came to a cottage where
an old lady lived. All of the villagers were
scared to death, and some of them started to get
their shotguns and rifles with which to kill Mr.
Bruin. But the old lady had her own idea of
what to do. She grabbed up a broomstick and
began to hammer that bear right on his nose, and
would you believe me? Mr. Bruin got so scared
that he ran away and then went straight back to
his keeper and allowed himself to be chained up
again!"</p>

<p>"Shadow, is that a true story or a made-up
yarn?" asked Laura.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>"It was told to me down East, and they said
it was absolutely true," was the answer. "They
even gave me the name of the old lady."</p>

<p>"Say, Shadow, it was a wonder they didn't
give you the name of the broomstick," said Dave,
and with that there was a short laugh.</p>

<p>Dave, Roger, and Phil had been given two
rooms between them. One was considerably
smaller than the other, and this Dave occupied.
On the other side of a little hallway were the
girls, while Mr. and Mrs. Wadsworth and Dunston
Porter occupied large chambers next to the
living-room. In the rear were two tiny rooms
for the hired help. At the other bungalow Ben
and his friends occupied three little rooms, while
Mr. and Mrs. Basswood had a large apartment
off to one side. At this bungalow there was an
extra large living-room in which was placed,
among other things, a small upright piano, somewhat
out of tune but still usable.</p>

<p>"Now don't you boys dare to play any tricks
to-night!" said Laura, when she and her girl
friends were about to retire. "You just keep
your tricks for some other time."</p>

<p>"All right, Laura, I'll make Roger and Phil be
good," answered her brother. "I guess we are
all tired enough to sleep soundly." And he certainly
spoke the truth as far as he personally was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>concerned, for hardly had his head touched the
pillow than he was off to the land of dreams.</p>

<p>The boys were up bright and early on the following
morning. It was a beautiful day, with
the sun shining brightly and a gentle breeze blowing
from the West. To be sure, the forest back
of the bungalow was still wet, but it had dried off
down at the shore of the lake, and at the dock
where were located two rowboats and several
canoes.</p>

<p>"Let us all go out for a row after breakfast,"
suggested Dave. "It will limber us up."</p>

<p>The aroma of freshly-made coffee and of sizzling
bacon filled the air between the bungalows,
and soon the young folks who had gone down to
the dock to look at the lake and the craft on it,
came trooping back for their breakfast.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it would be more pleasant if
we could all eat together, Mrs. Wadsworth?"
said Laura, while they were partaking of the repast.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so, Laura, and maybe we'll be able
to arrange it," answered the lady. "Mrs. Basswood
spoke about it. They have a large living-room
there that might be utilized as a dining-room
for all, and in pleasant weather we might all eat
out on our wide porch."</p>

<p>"That's the talk!" cried Dave. "I'd rather
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>eat outdoors any time, if the weather would permit."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, let us eat on the porch!" cried Jessie.
And so, later on, it was arranged, the entire
party eating indoors only when it was wet.</p>

<p>The canoes had been turned over and were
perfectly dry, but the two rowboats had to be
bailed out. Various parties were made up to go
out, and presently Dave found himself in one of
the canoes with Jessie as his sole companion.</p>

<p>"Any particular place you'd like to go?" questioned
our hero, as he dipped his paddle into the
lake, and with a firm sweep sent the long and
graceful canoe gliding away from the little dock.</p>

<p>"Supposing we go along the shore, Dave?" answered
the girl. "I would like to see how it looks
beyond this cove."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll keep as close to shore as possible,"
he replied. And then they set off, leaving
the others to go where they pleased.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose there's any danger of our
upsetting?" queried Jessie.</p>

<p>"We won't upset if you keep perfectly still,"
answered Dave. "I think I can manage this craft
all right."</p>

<p>On and on they went over the smooth surface
of the lake, passing at times close to the shore and
under the overhanging branches of trees, which
at some points were very thick. In spots the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>water
was shallow, and so clear that they could see
the bottom with ease and occasionally catch sight
of fishes darting in one direction or another.</p>

<p>"I think we're going to have some fine times
fishing up here," declared the youth, as a beautiful
trout flashed by only a few feet away.</p>

<p>They were coming around a long curve of the
shore. Just ahead was a high point of rocks, on
which somebody had erected a rude summer-house
of untrimmed tree-branches.</p>

<p>"What a cute little place!" declared Jessie, in
delight.</p>

<p>"It must belong to some of the cottages around
the bend," answered Dave. "I believe there is
quite a colony somewhere up here."</p>

<p>They passed around the point of rocks, and a
few minutes later came in sight of several rustic
cottages set in a grove of trees. In front of the
cottages was a long, narrow dock, at which rested
several craft, including a fair-sized motor-boat.</p>

<p>"Hello, I didn't know there was a motor-boat
on this lake!" exclaimed Dave. "Whoever owns
it must have had some job getting it here."</p>

<p>No one was at the dock or on the motor-boat,
and passing that point, Dave sent his canoe along
another picturesque bit of the lake shore. Then,
as they made another turn, they came in sight of
a log cabin which had evidently been erected many
years before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>"Well, I never! Dave, what in the world are
those folks doing?"</p>

<p>The cry came from Jessie, and not without reason,
for they had suddenly come in sight of three
or four men and several ladies, all stationed in
front of the old log cabin. One of the men was
dressed in the garb of a woodsman; and he held
a large ax in his hands, raised over his head as if
to strike down one of the younger ladies. Then
another of the ladies rushed up, and fell on her
knees with upraised hands in front of the man.</p>

<p>"Hello, I know these people!" cried Dave, in
astonishment. "They are the moving-picture actors
who were on board that burning steam
yacht!"</p>
<br />
<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
<br />

<hr />
<br />
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h2>SOMETHING OF A QUARREL</h2>
<br />

<p>"The moving-picture actors, Dave?" queried
Jessie, in wonder.</p>

<p>"Yes. Don't you see the man over there with
the camera? He is grinding out a picture of that
scene."</p>

<p>"O my! is that the way they do it?" returned
the girl, with interest. "I've read about it, but I
never had a chance before to see how it was done."</p>

<p>Dave brought the canoe to a standstill, and
both watched the little drama being enacted before
the old log cabin. Our hero saw that the
young lady in the scene was Della Ford, and the
elderly lady the one she had called Aunt Bess.</p>

<p>"All over!" exclaimed a man, who stood beside
the individual at the moving-picture camera.
The latter had stopped turning the handle of the
machine, and now he proceeded to cover the whole
outfit with a black cloth.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad that's over!" those in the
canoe heard Della Ford exclaim. "Come, Aunt
Bess, let us go back to the water." The young
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>lady turned from the group, and as she did so she
caught sight of the canoe and its occupants. She
stared for an instant, and then her face lit up.</p>

<p>"Mr. Porter! is it possible!" she exclaimed.
"I certainly didn't expect to meet you up here.
Aunt Bess, here is the young gentleman who saved
us from drowning."</p>

<p>"You don't tell me!" came from the aunt, and
then both hurried their steps toward a tiny dock
beside which the canoe was resting.</p>

<p>"I certainly didn't expect to meet you again,
and away up here in the Adirondacks," answered
Dave, with a smile. And then, as the young moving-picture
actress came closer, he introduced the
girls to each other.</p>

<p>"This is my aunt, Mrs. Bess Ford," announced
Della, to Jessie. "I suppose you saw us acting
just now?"</p>

<p>"We did," answered Jessie. "It was quite
interesting."</p>

<p>"I suppose it is, to an outsider," responded the
young actress. "It gets to be an old story with
us; doesn't it, Aunt Bess?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mind it," returned the aunt. "I'd
rather be up here in the woods acting for the
movies than down in some stuffy theater in this
warm weather."</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Porter tell you what a grand hero
he is, Miss Wadsworth?" asked Della Ford, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>turning
to Jessie. "Oh, he's just the grandest hero
I ever met!" and she beamed on Dave.</p>

<p>"Come now, Miss Ford, please don't mention
it again," expostulated Dave. "I didn't do so
very much, and you know it."</p>

<p>"Isn't saving my life a good deal?" demanded
the young actress, archly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't mean that. What I mean is that
anybody could have done what I did."</p>

<p>"But you did it, young man, and you ought to
have credit for it," put in Mrs. Ford, bluntly.
"It was certainly a brave thing to do."</p>

<p>"It was; and I shall never cease to thank Mr.
Porter for it," went on Della Ford, and she gave
Dave another warm look, at which he blushed
more than ever.</p>

<p>This look was not lost on Jessie; and she bit her
lip in a way that showed she was not altogether
pleased. Then Mr. Appleby, the manager of the
moving-picture company, came forward, followed
by several others.</p>

<p>"This certainly is a surprise!" said the manager.
"First we meet on the Atlantic Ocean, and
next in the heart of the Adirondacks."</p>

<p>"It's like some of your changes in the movies,"
answered Dave, smiling. "You show us a shipwreck,
and then, presto! you transfer us to an office
in Wall Street. You must have to jump around
pretty lively to get all the scenes of a drama."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>"We don't take just one drama," explained Mr.
Appleby. "We sometimes do half a dozen or
more. For instance, while we are up here we
are going to take the outdoor scenes to fifteen or
twenty dramas. Then we'll go back to the city
and finish up with a number of interiors."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to be a moving-picture
actor, Mr. Porter?" asked Della Ford, eagerly.
"You could go into a nautical rescue scene very
nicely."</p>

<p>"There you go again, Miss Ford!" returned
Dave. "Just the same, it must be some fun being
in a moving picture."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, don't you go into any moving picture,"
interrupted Jessie, quickly.</p>

<p>"Why, what would be the harm?" he questioned.</p>

<p>"Oh, no particular harm, I suppose. Only
I shouldn't like it," she answered, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"You might get into our next scene," went on
Della Ford, ignoring Jessie's remark. "We are
going to have one that will show several canoes
besides the motor-boat tied up at the dock around
the bend."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll think about it," answered Dave,
hesitatingly; and then he went on to Mr. Appleby:
"By the way, is Ward Porton still with
you?"</p>

<p>"He is with my company, yes; but he is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>here just now," was the reply. "I expect him in
a week or so."</p>

<p>"I met him in Crumville, where I live."</p>

<p>"Is that so? I thought he had gone to his
old home down East. However, it doesn't matter;
he has a right to go where he pleases."</p>

<p>"By the way, Mr. Appleby, I would like to
speak to you in private for a moment," went on
Dave, and leaping ashore he drew the manager to
one side.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"You have a new member of your company, a
young fellow named Link Merwell."</p>

<p>"Yes, what of it?"</p>

<p>"Link Merwell is a criminal&mdash;a fugitive from
justice," answered Dave. And then he gave the
man some of the particulars already known to my
readers.</p>

<p>"If what you say is true, Porter, I don't want
that fellow in my company," said Mr. Appleby,
warmly. "What do you want me to do when he
comes, hold him a prisoner?"</p>

<p>"I wish you would do that, and let us know.
Mr. Wadsworth will take care of Merwell."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll do it&mdash;if he shows up. But
he may not do that&mdash;if he has found out that
you are in this vicinity," added the manager.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking he will make himself scarce," returned
Dave, with a grim smile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>In the meantime Della Ford had come down to
the side of the canoe.</p>

<p>"Where are you staying, Miss Wadsworth?"
questioned the young actress.</p>

<p>"At a bungalow near the end of the lake," returned
Jessie, and explained about the location
and who were in the party.</p>

<p>"Oh, how delightful! You will surely have a
splendid time here. We are located in the cottage
around the bend where you perhaps saw the
motor-boat tied up. I am sure we'll be very glad
to have you call on us."</p>

<p>"Thank you; perhaps we'll get this way again
some time," returned Jessie, somewhat coolly.</p>

<p>"You must come and see us, Mr. Porter, by
all means," went on the young moving picture actress
when our hero returned to the side of the
canoe. "And bring the others along, too. I
liked the appearance of your chums. You all
seemed to be so jolly."</p>

<p>"Dave, don't you think we ought to be going?"
questioned Jessie.</p>

<p>"Just as you say," he answered, and dipped his
paddle into the lake.</p>

<p>"Then you don't want to stay and take part
in that other picture?" called out Della Ford, as
the canoe began to leave the dock.</p>

<p>"Not to-day, Miss Ford," called back Dave.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>"But I may get into one of your pictures just for
the fun of it."</p>

<p>"Do! And don't forget to call at the cottage,"
returned the young lady; and then the
canoe passed out of hearing of those on the shore,
and a dozen strong strokes of the paddle sent the
frail craft out of sight around another headland.</p>

<p>"That certainly was a surprise," was Dave's
comment, as they passed along under some overhanging
trees. "I never dreamed of coming
across that moving-picture company in such a fashion
as that."</p>

<p>"What did you get out for?" asked Jessie,
curiously.</p>

<p>"I wanted to ask Mr. Appleby about Link Merwell.
He didn't know Link was a criminal. He
says if Link shows himself up here he will make
him a prisoner and notify us."</p>

<p>"Isn't it queer that Link should join that company!"</p>

<p>"Rather, although I suppose he has got to do
something for a living,&mdash;and I guess he isn't the
fellow to pick out hard work. Acting in the
movies must be easy&mdash;and lots of fun in the
bargain."</p>

<p>"You are not going to act with them, are you,
Dave?" questioned Jessie, with her big round
eyes full upon him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>"Oh, I don't know. I think perhaps it might
be sport."</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>"Miss Ford tried to make a regular hero out
of me. I wish she wouldn't do that."</p>

<p>"Well, it was a grand thing for you to do&mdash;to
pull her out of the water, Dave, and she ought
to be exceedingly grateful. Just the same, I don't
think I like her very much," and Jessie pouted a
little.</p>

<p>"Is that so? Why, I thought she was real
nice."</p>

<p>"She's awfully forward."</p>

<p>"I didn't notice that. But maybe it's her calling
makes her so. An actress can't be just like
other people."</p>

<p>"I think she might be when she wasn't acting.
Anyway, I think she was too&mdash;well, too gushing."</p>

<p>"I noticed that you didn't give her any invitation
to call when she invited you," went on Dave,
after a pause, during which they left the vicinity
of the shore and swept out into Mirror Lake.</p>

<p>"Why should I? Mamma might not approve
of it. I don't think she has a very high opinion
of moving-picture actors and actresses."</p>

<p>"And I guess you haven't either, Jessie," returned
Dave, somewhat bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know about that," and the girl
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>tossed her head. "They have a right to act in
the movies if they want to. They've got to earn
their living some way, I suppose. Don't you think
we had better be getting back, Dave?"</p>

<p>"Why, it's early yet, Jessie!"</p>

<p>"Never mind, I think I would rather go back.
Now that the sun is overhead it is quite warm."</p>

<p>Dave started to answer, and then suddenly shut
his mouth tightly. The paddle went deeper into
the water, and the canoe shot around quickly in a
long semicircle.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave! don't tip us over!"</p>

<p>"Don't fear. The canoe won't go over if you
sit perfectly still," he replied, in a tone that was
somewhat unsympathetic.</p>

<p>"Are you going back to the bungalows?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly. That was what you wanted&mdash;to
go back; wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"We haven't got to race back, have we?"</p>

<p>"I'm not racing; but I thought you wanted to
get out of this hot sun."</p>

<p>"Dave, I think you're angry with me," returned
Jessie, reproachfully, but she did not raise her eyes
as before. Instead she kept them fastened on the
bottom of the canoe.</p>

<p>"Angry? What foolishness! What is there
for me to be angry about?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you know well enough."</p>

<p>"I don't see why you should feel so cut up over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>Miss Ford. I can't help it if she is grateful&mdash;as
you put it&mdash;for my saving her from drowning;
can I?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't that, Dave. Of course she ought
to be grateful. But you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;" Jessie's
voice broke a little and she could not go on.</p>

<p>"Me? I haven't done a thing! Didn't you
hear me tell her to quit it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it wasn't what you said. It was&mdash;&mdash;But
never mind, let us get back to the bungalow."
And Jessie kept her eyes on the bottom of the
canoe, refusing to look at her companion.</p>

<p>"And I'm sure I didn't do a thing either. Now
please don't be silly and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dave! Silly!"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that exactly, Jessie. But you
know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's not a bit nice for you to call me silly!" retorted
the girl, her face flaming.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean just that, Jessie. I meant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You did mean it! You think I am silly, do
you? All right, you can think so! Please paddle
straight for our dock."</p>

<p>"Now, Jessie&mdash;&mdash;" began Dave, entreatingly.</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear another word! Take
me straight to the dock," retorted the girl.</p>

<p>"Very well, if you won't listen to me you don't
have to," answered Dave; and now he, too,
showed that he was completely out of sorts.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>He struck the paddle deeper than ever into the
water, and with long, telling strokes the canoe
shot forward over the lake in the direction of
Bear Camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h2>VISITORS</h2>
<br />

<p>Several days went by and during that time the
coldness that had sprung up between Dave and
Jessie increased, although both did their best to
hide it from the others.</p>

<p>One afternoon while the girl was off with Laura
and Belle for a tramp along a brook that flowed
into the lake not far from the bungalows, Mr.
Appleby came into the cove in his motor-boat,
bringing with him an old hunter and guide of that
vicinity, named Tad Rason, and also Della Ford
and her Aunt Bess. They found Dave, Roger,
and Phil at the dock, fishing.</p>

<p>"Any luck?" called out the manager of the
moving-picture company, cheerily.</p>

<p>"Some, but not a great deal," answered Dave,
and he and the others pulled in their lines, so that
they might not become entangled in the propeller
of the boat.</p>

<p>"You'll have to go to the other shore for good
fishing," said Tad Rason, who had already shown
himself at the bungalows and made himself known.</p>

<p>"The fish are mighty scarce around here."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>"I'd like to go fishing sometime!" exclaimed
Della, with a smile and a nod to Dave and his
chums. "I never caught a fish in my life. Mr.
Porter, couldn't you show me how to do it?" she
asked, sweetly.</p>

<p>"I might, if the fish was willing to be caught,"
answered Dave, with a grin.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure I could catch one if you would
only show me how," returned the young actress.</p>

<p>"Well, if you are going to fish with worms
you've got to first learn how to put one on a hook,"
said Phil.</p>

<p>"O my! I'm sure that I don't want to put a
squirming worm on any hook!" cried Della, with
a slight shudder. "I want to fish with one of
those beautiful flies, it's so much more interesting."</p>

<p>"I came down on a peculiar errand," broke in
Mr. Appleby, after he had tied up at the dock.
"I would like to borrow a little furniture from
you for one day only."</p>

<p>"Furniture?" queried Roger.</p>

<p>"Yes. You see, we have an interior scene up
at our cottage, but we haven't got just the furniture
that the drama calls for. I noticed when I
stopped at your bungalows yesterday that you had
several pieces that are just the ones required. If
you will lend them to me to-day, I will see that
you get them back safely by to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You'll have to see Mrs. Wadsworth and Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>Basswood about that," returned Dave. "Not
but that I think it will be all right," he added,
hastily.</p>

<p>"Come up here to do some shooting, I suppose,
just as soon as the season opens?" remarked
Tad Rason, to the boys.</p>

<p>"Well, we won't object to bringing down a
deer or two if we get the chance," answered our
hero. "But I rather imagine deer are scarce
around here. I haven't seen any of them yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, you'll find plenty of deer up at the head
of the lake," returned the old hunter. "They
don't come down here much. They always left
this spot for the bears."</p>

<p>"The bears! Oh, Mr. Rason! you surely don't
mean that?" cried Della Ford.</p>

<p>"But I certainly do, ma'am. This was always
a great place for bears. That's why they call this
end of the lake Bear Camp. I shot one of 'em
here last winter, and I got an old she-bear and
her two cubs here two years afore that."</p>

<p>"We haven't seen any traces of bears," said
Phil.</p>

<p>"You'll see 'em sooner or later," returned the
old hunter, with conviction. "They are bound to
come here."</p>

<p>"What makes you say they are bound to
come?" questioned Dave, curiously. "Is there
any particular reason for it?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>"I think there is, young man. So far as I can
understand it, I think the bears come here in the
fall to get certain roots and herbs that they like to
eat. I think they find more of 'em around here
than they do anywhere else, and that's what fetches
'em."</p>

<p>"And do you think the bears keep the deer
away from here?" questioned Roger.</p>

<p>"I don't know as to that. But I do know that
bears and deer don't mix very well," answered Tad
Rason.</p>

<p>While Mr. Appleby was negotiating with Mrs.
Wadsworth and Mrs. Basswood for the loan of
several pieces of rustic furniture which the bungalows
contained, Della Ford and her aunt visited
with the boys. The young actress wanted to know
all about what the young folks at the bungalows
had been doing, and expressed her delight at the
cosiness of the place, and its beautiful surroundings.</p>

<p>Mr. Appleby, aided by Tad Rason, carried the
borrowed furniture down to the motor-boat.
There was more of it than the manager had at
first anticipated taking, and, as a consequence, the
craft was well loaded.</p>

<p>"I don't see how we are going to sit in there
with all that furniture packed around us!" exclaimed
Della, in dismay, as she viewed the situation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>"You might sit in that rocking-chair on the
bow," suggested Phil, with a broad smile; and at
this suggestion there was a general laugh.</p>

<p>"No, thank you. I have no desire to be spilled
overboard. I went overboard once, and that was
quite enough," answered the young actress.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we might do," answered
Dave. "We could take you and your aunt in
one of the rowboats, and have the motor-boat
tow it."</p>

<p>"Oh, that would be lovely!" cried Della.
"What do you say, Aunt Bess; shall we do it?"</p>

<p>"I'm willing, if it is safe," answered the aunt,
"I don't want to go to the bottom of this lake any
more than I wanted to go to the bottom of the Atlantic
Ocean."</p>

<p>"It's perfectly safe," answered Dave. "The
boat's a good broad one, so there is no danger of
its tipping over&mdash;not unless Mr. Appleby makes
a quick turn, and I don't suppose he will do that."</p>

<p>"If I pull your rowboat I'll be as steady as an
old freight engine," was the manager's reply.
"It's very kind of you boys to do this."</p>

<p>The best and broadest of the rowboats was
brought around, and Della Ford and her aunt
were assisted into the craft. Then, after the boys
had procured a pair of oars, they, too, embarked,
and the motor-boat headed back for the moving
picture company's camp.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>"Hello! hello! Where are you going?"</p>

<p>The cry came from the shore at a point where
the brook ran into the lake, and looking in that
direction, those in the rowboat saw Jessie, Laura,
and Belle just emerging from behind some brushwood
and rocks. The girl from the West was
swinging her broad hat vigorously.</p>

<p>"We are going to take these ladies home!"
yelled Dave. "We'll be back soon."</p>

<p>"Oh, see; the motor-boat is loaded with furniture!"
exclaimed Dave's sister. "What a
funny sight!"</p>

<p>"I didn't know those folks were going to visit
us to-day," was Jessie's comment, and her face
showed she was not at all pleased.</p>

<p>"See! they have Miss Ford and her aunt with
them," said Belle. "Miss Ford is a stunning
girl; isn't she?"</p>

<p>"She certainly is quite good-looking," returned
Laura. "What do you say, Jessie?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think she is any better-looking
than lots of other girls I know," returned Jessie,
rather coldly. "Come on, let's get back to the
bungalows; this long tramp has tired me dreadfully."</p>

<p>"You do look rather pale," said Belle, kindly.
"Don't you feel well?"</p>

<p>"I've got a little headache, that's all. I think
I'll go back to the bungalow and rest," returned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>Jessie; and went on ahead, soon disappearing
within one of the buildings.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Laura, I don't believe Jessie
likes that Miss Ford a bit," was the comment of
the western girl, when she was alone with Dave's
sister.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't she like Miss Ford, Belle?
She seems to be a nice enough girl, and I don't
think the fact she acts in the movies ought to be
held against her."</p>

<p>"I don't think it is that, Laura. It is something
else."</p>

<p>"Something else? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know that I ought to mention it.
Come on, let us get up to the bungalows."</p>

<p>"But, Belle, do tell me what you think,"
pleaded Laura. "You know you haven't any
right to keep back anything from me," and she
caught her chum around the shoulder and held her
tightly.</p>

<p>"Well, if you must know, it's this: Jessie can't
forget that Dave saved Miss Ford from drowning."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see what you mean, Belle! You think
that because Dave did that Jessie thinks he might
get more interested in her than would otherwise
be the case."</p>

<p>"Not exactly that, Laura. Jessie may imagine
that Miss Ford is quite interested in Dave."</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>"Oh, I see!" Dave's sister was silent for a
moment. "But you forget one thing, Belle;
Dave saved Jessie's life, too. Don't you remember
that I told you of it? A gasoline tank exploded,
and she was in danger of being burned to
death when Dave jumped in and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I remember that very well, and you
may be sure that Jessie remembers it, too. But
then this rescue was so much more recent."</p>

<p>At these words Laura grew more thoughtful
than ever, and suddenly she caught her western
chum by the arm and pulled Belle into a path leading
to the dock.</p>

<p>"What now, Laura?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Belle! do you really think there is anything
in that? Do you think that is what has
made Jessie act so queerly for the last couple of
days? I noticed she was not herself at all; and
Dave seemed to be different, too."</p>

<p>"If you want the truth of it, I do think there is
some sort of a quarrel between them. Of course,
I am not sure it is on Miss Ford's account. But
they don't act as they used to."</p>

<p>"It's too bad!" and Laura's face showed great
seriousness. "I wouldn't have anything come between
Dave and Jessie for the world!"</p>

<p>"It would be a great shame, there is no doubt
of that," answered the girl from the ranch.</p>

<p>When the pair entered the bungalow they found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>that Jessie had gone to her room. She was lying
on a couch, and though the light was dim, Laura
could see quite plainly that her friend had been
crying.</p>

<p>"You poor dear!" said Dave's sister, going
up and placing her hand on Jessie's forehead.
"Is your headache worse?"</p>

<p>"Not much, Laura," was the answer. Jessie
turned over with her face toward the wall. "I
just want to be left alone awhile, and then I'll be
all right."</p>

<p>"Don't you want me to get you anything at
all?"</p>

<p>"No. Just leave me alone, that's all."</p>

<p>Laura stood by the side of the couch for a moment.
She was on the point of speaking again.
She wanted very much to relieve her mind, but
concluded that it might not be a wise thing to do.
She tiptoed to the doorway, where she encountered
Belle, and both walked to another part of
the bungalow.</p>

<p>"And do you really think it was a headache,
Laura?" whispered Belle, when the two were safe
out of earshot of any of the others.</p>

<p>"She may have a headache, but I think it is
more than that," was the reply from Dave's sister.
"Oh, Belle, if matters are as you think they
are, what in the world are we going to do?"</p>

<p>"I don't know of anything to do, Laura. I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>don't believe it would be a wise thing to say anything
to Jessie."</p>

<p>"Then suppose I talk to Dave?"</p>

<p>"You can suit yourself about that. But if I
were you I'd be very careful. Boys are as touchy
as girls when it comes to a subject like that."</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?"</p>

<p>"I certainly do."</p>

<p>"Then I will be very cautious. But I've just
got to say something," declared Laura.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h2>A STRANGE COMMUNICATION</h2>
<br />

<p>The three boys had quite some sport going up
the lake with Della Ford and her aunt as passengers.
Being towed by the motor-boat, they had
nothing to do but take it easy, and they spent the
time in chatting of things in general, and of moving
pictures and fun on Mirror Lake in particular.</p>

<p>"We would be pleased to have you come up
some evening and take dinner with us," said Della
Ford, after consulting with the manager of the
moving-picture company. "Come up and bring
that boy with his banjo, and we'll have a lot of
fun."</p>

<p>"All right, we'll be up some time," answered
Phil.</p>

<p>"And don't forget, Mr. Porter, that some day
you're to show me how to catch a fish," called out
the young actress.</p>

<p>"All right, I won't forget," answered Dave;
and then the three boys pushed the rowboat away
from the dock, and started upon the return to
Bear Camp.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>"She's a mighty pleasant girl, that's sure," remarked
Phil, as he took it easy on the stern seat,
while Dave and Roger plied the oars.</p>

<p>"I think Dave has made a hit with her," responded
Roger, with a sly wink at the shipowner's
son.</p>

<p>"If you don't look out I'll make a hit with somebody
in this boat," declared Dave, his face flushing.
"You attend to your rowing or we won't
get back in time for dinner."</p>

<p>"I thought you said that fellow, Ward Porton,
was going to join the company up here," remarked
Phil, by way of changing the subject.</p>

<p>"All I know about it is what Mr. Appleby told
me," returned Dave. "I'd like first-rate to see
him again and ask him some more about Link
Merwell."</p>

<p>"Do you think Link will come up here?" asked
Roger.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think. He is likely to
do almost anything. But I doubt whether he will
want to place himself in any position where we
can get hold of him."</p>

<p>"What a fool Link has been," was Phil's comment.</p>

<p>When the rowboat returned to the dock at the
camp, the boys found only Laura and Belle on the
veranda of one of the bungalows.</p>

<p>"Where's Jessie?" asked Dave.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>"She has a headache and is lying down," answered
Laura, and looked at her brother closely.</p>

<p>"That's too bad," he answered. "Can't you
do anything for it?"</p>

<p>"She wanted to be left alone, Dave."</p>

<p>"I wonder if I can't do something?"</p>

<p>"I don't think so."</p>

<p>Roger and Phil sat down on the veranda, and
were soon joined by Luke and Shadow.</p>

<p>"Where is Ben?" questioned Roger.</p>

<p>"He went to Carpen Falls with his father and
Mr. Porter for the mail," answered Mrs. Basswood,
who had joined the group.</p>

<p>"I hope I get a letter from daddy," cried Belle.
"Why, just think! I haven't had a letter for
three days," she pouted.</p>

<p>"I'd like a letter, too," put in Phil. "I haven't
had a word from home since I left," and his face
clouded, as he remembered his father's troubles
over the land question.</p>

<p>Dave had been seated on the end of the piazza,
but now he arose and walked over to the other
bungalow. Here he met Mrs. Wadsworth just
coming from Jessie's room.</p>

<p>"It's only a slight headache, Dave," said the
lady, in answer to his question. "I think Jessie
will be all right in the morning. She thought she
had better stay where she is this evening."</p>

<p>"I wish I could help her, Mrs. Wadsworth,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>returned the youth, quickly. "Isn't there something
I can do?"</p>

<p>"Nothing that I know of," was the reply, and
then Mrs. Wadsworth walked out of the bungalow
to join her husband, who was smoking a cigar
in a little pavilion that overlooked the lake.</p>

<p>Dave took a turn or two across the living-room.
He was very much disturbed in mind, and felt that
he ought to do something.</p>

<p>"I'll take a chance, and knock on the door anyhow,"
he told himself, and moving to the door of
Jessie's room, he tapped lightly. Then, as there
was no response, he tapped again.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" came from the girl.</p>

<p>"It is I, Jessie. Can't I do something for
you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't think you can," she returned,
quickly.</p>

<p>"The others told me you had a headache. I'm
very sorry to hear that. I wish I could do something
to make you feel better."</p>

<p>"You can't do a thing."</p>

<p>"I might get a hot-water bottle, or some
chopped ice, or&mdash;or&mdash;something," he faltered,
not knowing how to go on.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, don't be silly!"</p>

<p>"Silly! So now I'm the one who's silly; am
I?" he returned. But there was more of slyness
than bitterness in his tone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>"Dave Porter! Was there ever such a boy!
Now you must go away and leave me alone!"</p>

<p>"All right, Jessie, if you want me to go away
I'll go. Just the same, I want you to know that
I'm awfully, <i>awfully</i> sorry that you have a headache.
I'd rather have it myself."</p>

<p>"Would you indeed?" There was a creaking
of the couch, as if Jessie had turned and was sitting
up. "Well, I don't want you to have a headache.
They are not a bit nice! They are horrid!"</p>

<p>"Are you lying down?"</p>

<p>"I was lying down."</p>

<p>"Well, if you're not so very, very sick, Jessie,
won't you just come to the door a minute? I want
to tell you something," went on Dave, after a moment's
hesitation.</p>

<p>The girl came slowly to the door, and opened
it several inches, showing a mass of disheveled
hair, and cheeks that had traces of tears on them.</p>

<p>"What do you want to tell me?"</p>

<p>"A good many things, Jessie," returned Dave,
in a low tone. "First of all, I don't want you to
be angry with me. I simply can't bear it. And
besides, I don't think you have anything to be
angry about."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!"</p>

<p>"No, I don't. I think you misunderstand me.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>Why, Jessie, I wouldn't have anything come between
us for the world, and you know it!"</p>

<p>"Do I?" The door opened a little wider.</p>

<p>"Yes, you do. You know there isn't any one
that I care for one-tenth part as much as I care
for you. I didn't go up the lake this afternoon
because I particularly wanted to; and those people
came here of their own accord."</p>

<p>"Yes, Dave&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I don't want you to act so cold, Jessie.
Why, it cuts a fellow to the heart! If I
thought&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A wild yell, followed by several screams of terror
from outside, interrupted the conversation.
Dave stopped short to listen, and Jessie threw
wide-open the door to do likewise. Another yell
rang out, fierce and penetrating, and then came
several more screams, and a rush of footsteps.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave! what can it mean?" cried Jessie,
in sudden alarm.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I guess I had better find out,"
he returned, and ran toward the front doorway.</p>

<p>"Be careful, Dave! be careful!" cautioned the
girl, pleadingly. "Maybe it's a bear!"</p>

<p>"In that case I'd better get one of the guns,"
he returned.</p>

<p>The party had brought a number of firearms
with them, and several of the pieces were hung
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>up on the walls, loaded and ready for use. Catching
up a double-barreled shotgun, Dave ran outside
with Jessie at his heels. The commotion had
continued, and now the youth found himself confronted
by his sister and Belle.</p>

<p>"What is it, Laura?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, exactly. But it certainly was
something awful!"</p>

<p>"I think it must have been a wild man," broke
in Belle. "Anyhow, if it wasn't, I don't know
what else it could have been."</p>

<p>The other boys had left the vicinity of the bungalows,
and were running toward the woods, with
Mr. Wadsworth following them.</p>

<p>"They saw something, but they don't know
what it was," said Mrs. Wadsworth, who was
plainly much agitated. "It let out the most awful
yells you ever heard."</p>

<p>"Maybe it was that wild man, Wilbur Poole!"
exclaimed Dave. "He might have followed us
to this place, you know."</p>

<p>He ran on, and soon joined the other boys and
Mr. Wadsworth, who had come to a halt at the
edge of the clearing on which the bungalows were
located.</p>

<p>"I think he disappeared over here!" cried
Shadow.</p>

<p>"And I think he went this way!" returned
Luke.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>"When I saw him last he was by yonder
bushes!" were Roger's words.</p>

<p>"I think he went over there, just as Shadow
said!" came from Phil.</p>

<p>"Who was it?" asked Dave. "Wilbur
Poole?"</p>

<p>"Whoever he was, he had the most outlandish
rig on a fellow ever saw!" exclaimed Luke. "I
think he must have borrowed it from some scarecrow."</p>

<p>"If that was Wilbur Poole we had better keep
our eyes open for him," said Dave, seriously. He
had not forgotten the trouble which the wild man
who called himself the King of Sumatra had given
him and his chums in the past.</p>

<p>"We were all sitting there enjoying ourselves
when we heard the fellow give an awful yell or
two," explained Phil. "Then he came dancing
out from behind some bushes, waving a sort of
sceptre in the air. He nearly scared the girls into
fits, and that is what made them scream. Then
he caught up a stick of wood from the pile yonder,
and disappeared between the trees. I guess he
must have imagined he was a wild Indian on the
warpath."</p>

<p>"I am afraid if that poor fellow isn't captured
he will cause us a good deal of worry," was Mr.
Wadsworth's comment. "As long as he is at
large there is no telling what he will do."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>"If it really is Wilbur Poole, we ought to let
the Pooles know about it," said Dave.</p>

<p>The matter was talked over for some time, and
then, after another search through the edge of the
woods and among the rocks and brushwood of that
vicinity, the boys and Mr. Wadsworth returned to
the bungalows. They found all of the girls and
Mrs. Wadsworth on one of the verandas, discussing
the situation. Even Jessie had joined the
group, declaring that the alarm had scared most
of her headache away.</p>

<p>"Oh, I was so frightened when I first saw the
man&mdash;if it really was a man!" cried Laura.</p>

<p>"He looked more like an orang-outang," declared
the girl from the West. "If I had met
him out on the range, and if I had had a gun with
me, I surely would have shot at him!"</p>

<p>"I brought a gun along," returned Dave, exhibiting
the weapon; "I thought it was a bear
scare."</p>

<p>The scare was the topic of conversation all
through the dinner hour, and it was decided that
a letter should be posted to Mr. Aaron Poole the
following morning, acquainting him with what had
occurred.</p>

<p>"It's queer that my husband and Ben and Mr.
Porter don't come," remarked Mrs. Basswood,
when the meal was nearly over and it was growing
dark.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>"It's quite a walk to Carpen Falls," said Dave.
"And you must remember the trail isn't any too
good in some spots."</p>

<p>"I think I see them coming now," announced
Roger, a minute later; and he was right. Soon
Ben and his father and Dunston Porter came into
full view near the end of the lake.</p>

<p>"Talk about an adventure!" cried Ben, as they
came up. "Who do you think we met?"</p>

<p>"The wild man!" burst out several of those
present.</p>

<p>"Oh, then he was here, was he? Was it Wilbur
Poole?"</p>

<p>"We are not so sure about that. We didn't
get a very good look at him. He had on such
a queer outfit that he was completely disguised."</p>

<p>"That's just it!" broke in Dunston Porter.
"We couldn't tell who he was, either. He appeared
right in front of us on the trail, flourishing
a big stick. He let out a whoop like an Indian,
gave a leap or two into the air, and then dashed
out of sight behind some bushes."</p>

<p>"He didn't attack you, did he?" questioned
Mrs. Basswood, anxiously.</p>

<p>"No," returned her husband, "but, all the
same, I didn't like his actions. He might have
done some serious damage with the stick he carried."</p>

<p>"That man, whoever he is, ought to be put <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>under
guard," declared Phil, and then he added
quickly: "Did you get any letters, Ben?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, several of them. Here they are,"
and placing his hand in the pocket of his jacket,
the youth brought forth over a dozen epistles.</p>

<p>There was a wild scramble, and the letters were
quickly distributed.</p>

<p>"Oh, good! Here's a letter from dear dad!"
exclaimed Belle. "Excuse me while I read it,"
and she quickly tore open the communication.</p>

<p>All of the girls had letters, and there was also
one for Dave and another for Phil. As our hero
looked at the communication addressed to him, he
could not help but start. He thought he recognized
the handwriting as that of Link Merwell.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he has got to say now," he
mused, and then as the others began reading their
letters, he opened the envelope and took out the
single sheet it contained.</p>

<p>In a large, heavy hand were scrawled these
words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I think before long you will be getting what
is coming to you, you poorhouse nobody."</p></div>

<p>There was no signature.</p>
<br />
<br />
<br /><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h2>THE SWIMMING RACE</h2>
<br />

<p>Dave read the brief communication over several
times. As he did so his face showed both
perplexity and anger. Roger, who had received
no letter and who therefore had nothing to read,
looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"No bad news, I hope?" he said, as he came
up to Dave.</p>

<p>"I think it's another communication from that
good-for-nothing Link Merwell," returned Dave.
"Here, you can read it for yourself," and he
passed the letter over.</p>

<p>The senator's son read the scrawl, and his face
showed his disgust.</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, Dave, it must be from
Link Merwell."</p>

<p>"Link Merwell!" broke in Shadow, who sat
on a bench near by. "What about that rascal;
have you heard something further of him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it doesn't amount to anything," returned
Dave, hastily, and taking the communication he
thrust it into his pocket. "Don't say anything
about it," he added to Roger, in a low tone.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>"All right, I won't if you want it that way,"
answered his chum. "Just the same, Dave, this
looks to me as if Link was plotting once more to
do you an injury."</p>

<p>"If so, Roger, would he be fool enough to
notify me beforehand?" queried our hero, as the
pair walked a little distance away from the others.</p>

<p>"There is no telling what a fellow of Link's
stamp might do. He is just fool enough to brag
about what he hoped to do rather than go and
do it. It's an outrage that he should call you a
'poorhouse nobody.'"</p>

<p>"I'd thrash him for it if I could get my hands
on him," returned Dave, quickly, and his face
showed deep resentment. He had not forgotten
how, in years gone by, his enemies had taunted
him with being a "poorhouse nobody," and how
he had had to fight his way through until his
identity had been established.</p>

<p>"Anyway, Dave, this gives you a chance to be
on your guard," went on Roger. "If I were you
I'd keep my eyes wide open for Link Merwell."</p>

<p>"I certainly shall, Roger. And if I can lay my
hands on him I won't be as considerate as I was
on Cave Island," was the answer. "I'll hold him
until I can turn him over to the authorities. He
ought to be keeping company with Jasniff in jail."</p>

<p>The girls were chattering among themselves
over the letters they had received, and Shadow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>and Luke soon joined in. As was to be expected,
the former story-teller of Oak Hall had his usual
anecdote to relate, to which the others listened
with interest. Phil had drawn apart from the
crowd, and was now reading the letter he had received
a second time. His face indicated unusual
concern.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you got good news, Phil," remarked
Dave, as the shipowner's son came towards
him and Roger.</p>

<p>"No, it's just the opposite," was the somewhat
doleful reply.</p>

<p>"What? Do you mean it's bad news?" broke
in Roger, quickly.</p>

<p>"It certainly is! Instead of losing twenty to
thirty thousand dollars, my dad stands to lose
about fifty thousand dollars on that land deal I
mentioned to you some time ago."</p>

<p>"Why, how is that?" queried our hero, curiously.
"Has the land gone up in value since
then?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about the value of the land itself,
but it's this way: Since that railroad made a
bid for the acreage, another railroad has come
into the field. They are going to run a rival line
through that territory, and so they bid against
the L. A. &amp; H. Then the L. A. &amp; H. railroad
increased their bid, and the other folks did the
same, so that now, if my father could give a clear
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>deed to the land, he could sell it for about fifty
thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"And hasn't he been able to get any trace of
your Uncle Lester?"</p>

<p>"He has something of a clue, but so far he has
been unable to locate my uncle. It certainly is a
strange state of affairs."</p>

<p>"Won't the railroad company take the land
without your uncle being represented in the deed?"
questioned Roger.</p>

<p>"I don't think so. If they were willing to do
that my father would put the deal through without
delay. It certainly is too bad!" added Phil,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"It seems to me if I were you I'd get on the
trail of your Uncle Lester somehow," was Roger's
comment. "I wouldn't let that fifty thousand
dollars get away from me. I'd hire detectives to
scour the whole United States for the missing
man."</p>

<p>"My father's doing all he can, Roger." Phil
turned to our hero. "You got a letter, didn't
you?"</p>

<p>"Not much of a one, Phil." Dave hesitated
for a moment: "Here, you might as well see it.
I showed it to Roger. But don't say anything to
the others about it, especially the girls. There is
no use in worrying them. As it is, they have had
scare enough from that wild man."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>The shipowner's son read the letter Dave had
received with interest.</p>

<p>"Sure, that's from Link Merwell! I know
his handwriting almost as well as I know my own,"
he declared. "He always makes those funny little
crooks on his capital letters. I guess that
shows what kind of a crook he is," and Phil
grinned at his little joke. "What are you going
to do about this, Dave?"</p>

<p>"I don't see that there's anything to do about
it. As I told Roger, if Link shows himself
around here I'll do all I can to place him in the
hands of the authorities and see to it that he goes
to jail."</p>

<p>"It's a beastly shame that any one should write
such a note as that," went on the shipowner's son.
"You are not a 'poorhouse nobody,' and everybody
knows it."</p>

<p>"I've been wondering what Link Merwell can
have up his sleeve," came from Roger. "He certainly
must be up to something, or he wouldn't
send such a letter as that."</p>

<p>The matter was talked over for a little while
longer by the three boys, and then they rejoined
the others.</p>

<p>Jessie declared that her headache was now gone
completely, and the young folks spent the rest of
the evening in the Basswood bungalow, where
Belle played the piano and Luke favored them
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>with several selections on his banjo and his guitar.
They also sang a number of songs, and altogether
the evening ended quite pleasantly. The cloud
that had come up between Dave and Jessie seemed
to have vanished, much to their own satisfaction,
and to that of their friends.</p>

<p>On the following morning Mr. Basswood announced
that he had to return to Crumville for a
few days on business. He said that as soon as
he arrived home he would get into telephone communication
with Mr. Aaron Poole and acquaint
him with the fact that some sort of a wild man
had visited the vicinity of Bear Camp.</p>

<p>"Of course we may be mistaken as to the
identity of that individual," said Ben's father.
"He may not be Wilbur Poole at all."</p>

<p>"You want to be sure, Dad, and let Nat's father
know that," said Ben, "because if Mr. Poole
spent money up here looking for his brother, and
then found out that the wild man was somebody
else, he would never forgive either himself or you
for the outlay." And at this frank statement
those who knew how miserly the money-lender of
Crumville was laughed outright.</p>

<p>Mr. Basswood departed for Carpen Falls in
the middle of the forenoon. As it promised to
be a warm, clear day, one of the young folks
suggested that they go in bathing at a little sandy
beach a short distance below the bungalows. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>suggestion was eagerly seconded, and as a consequence,
a little later on, the young folks donned
their bathing outfits and soon were having great
sport in the water, with the older folks sitting on
a fallen tree not far away watching them.</p>

<p>"Oh, but it's cold!" declared Jessie, after her
first plunge.</p>

<p>"You'll get used to it after a bit," returned
Dave. "Just strike out lively, and that will help
to keep your blood in circulation."</p>

<p>"Come on for a race!" shouted Luke, who
was splashing around in great shape.</p>

<p>"A race it is!" called back Phil.</p>

<p>"Where shall we race to?" questioned Roger.</p>

<p>"If you are going to race, I'll be the referee and
timekeeper," announced Dunston Porter.</p>

<p>It was decided that the boys should swim from
the beach to a rock standing out of the water on
the far edge of the cove.</p>

<p>"First fellow to stand up on the rock wins the
prize," announced Phil, and then he added quickly:
"Girls, what's the prize?"</p>

<p>"A fresh flapjack to the boy who bakes it,"
announced Belle, gaily.</p>

<p>"Say, speaking of flapjacks puts me in mind
of a story," came from Shadow, who was wading
around in water up to his ankles. "Once there
were two old miners who were in a camp in the
mountains. They got to disputing as to who could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>make the best flapjacks. Says one of them&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shadow did not finish the story he had started
to tell. Unbeknown to him, Roger had come up
behind, and was now on his hands and knees in
the water. Luke gave the would-be story-teller
a quick shove; and over went Shadow backwards,
to land in the shallow water with a resounding
splash.</p>

<p>"Flapjack number one!" cried Luke, gaily.
"Say, Shadow, what are you making so much noise
about?"</p>

<p>"I'll noise you!" roared the former story-teller
of Oak Hall, as he scrambled to his feet.</p>

<p>Then he started to rush after Luke, but Roger
caught him by his ankle, and down he went into
the water with another splash, this time sending
the spray flying clear to those sitting on the fallen
tree.</p>

<p>"Here! Here! You boys stop that!" cried
Mrs. Wadsworth. "We haven't any umbrellas."</p>

<p>"Oh, excuse me, I didn't mean to shower you,"
pleaded Shadow. "Anyway, it was Roger's
fault."</p>

<p>"If you are going to race, start in!" ordered
Dunston Porter.</p>

<p>"Well, what's the prize?" queried Roger,
doing his best to keep out of Shadow's reach.</p>

<p>"The fellow who wins gets the hole in the
doughnut," returned Dave, gaily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>"All ready! Line up!" ordered Dunston
Porter, and after a general scramble and amid
much merriment, the boys lined up. Then came
the order "Go!" and all of them struck out
lustily for the rock that marked the goal.</p>

<p>At first Ben, who had taken but little interest in
the horseplay just enacted, kept well to the front.
Ben had always been a good swimmer, and many a
time he and Dave had raced each other in Crumville
Creek.</p>

<p>"You fellows won't be in it!" he shouted merrily.</p>

<p>"Don't you be too sure of that," returned Luke.
"This race isn't over yet."</p>

<p>"You fellows had better save your wind," spluttered
Phil, who at that instant came up alongside
of Shadow. There followed a great splashing of
water, and suddenly Ben disappeared from view.</p>

<p>"Hey, you! Who fouled me that way?"
roared the leader. "Whoever caught me by the
foot ought to be put out of this race."</p>

<p>"Must have been a whale, Ben," answered
Roger, mischievously.</p>

<p>"I'll whale you if you do it again," was the
answer. And then all of the boys stopped talking
and with renewed vigor bent to the task of trying
to win the race.</p>

<p>Soon half the distance to the rock was covered.
Ben was still in the lead, with Roger and Phil
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>close behind him. Luke and Shadow had dropped
so far to the rear that they gave up all hope of
winning.</p>

<p>"Here is where I leave you fellows," announced
Phil, and made a sudden spurt that soon placed
him slightly in advance of Ben.</p>

<p>"Hi! hi! don't leave me this way!" yelled
Roger, and he, too, put on a burst of speed, followed
a second later by Dave.</p>

<p>On and on, through the cool, clear waters of
Mirror Lake plunged the four boys. The goal
was now less than fifty feet away.</p>

<p>"O my, see how hard they are swimming!"
came from Laura.</p>

<p>"Ben was ahead, but I think Roger is up to
him," announced Mrs. Basswood.</p>

<p>"Those four lads are pretty well bunched up,"
remarked Dunston Porter.</p>

<p>"Shadow and Luke have dropped out of it,"
announced Belle. "Gracious, how those others
are swimming! Wouldn't you think it was for a
prize of a thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>The four who had remained in the race were
now less than five yards from the goal, a large
flat rock that was joined to the mainland by a
series of other rocks.</p>

<p>"Here is where I win!" declared Ben, and
threw himself forward with all the strength left
to him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>"Not much!" came from Phil.</p>

<p>"Count me in!" panted Roger.</p>

<p>"Also yours truly!" added Dave.</p>

<p>And then the four, lining up side by side, struck
out fiercely, each doing his level best to touch the
rock first. It was a neck-and-neck race, and in a
moment more four hands went up on the rock at
practically the same time.</p>

<p>"I win!"</p>

<p>"Not much, my hand was here first!"</p>

<p>"Oh, look!"</p>

<p>"Don't climb up on that rock!"</p>

<p>"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's a snake, and a big one!" yelled Dave.
"Back away from the rock, boys, just as fast as
you can!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h2>A CRY FROM THE CLIFF</h2>
<br />

<p>"It's a snake sure enough!"</p>

<p>"My, what a big one!"</p>

<p>"No climbing on that rock for me!"</p>

<p>Such were some of the cries which rent the air
as the four youths dropped back into the lake and
lost no time in getting away from the spot which
had been the goal of the swimming race.</p>

<p>"Say, Dave, what sort of a snake do you suppose
that was?" queried Roger.</p>

<p>"Did he drop into the water?" questioned
Ben, anxiously. "If it's a water snake maybe it's
after us."</p>

<p>"I don't know what kind of snakes are to be
found around here," returned Dave. "But it
was dark in color and I think all of four or five
feet long."</p>

<p>"Say, who won this race, anyhow?" came from
Phil, as the boys swam around not far from the
rock.</p>

<p>"I should say the snake did," laughed Dave.</p>

<p>In the meantime Dunston Porter, noticing that
something unusual was going on in the vicinity of
the goal, had leaped up and was running along the
edge of the cove.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>"What's the matter over there?" he yelled.</p>

<p>"A snake, Uncle Dunston," called back Dave.
"Better get a shotgun and go after it."</p>

<p>"O dear! did you say a snake?" came from
Laura, in dismay.</p>

<p>Acting on Dave's suggestion, Dunston Porter
hurried back to one of the bungalows. He reappeared
with a shotgun, and lost no time in making
for the vicinity of the rock where the reptile
had been seen. In the meanwhile the four boys
rejoined Luke and Shadow, and all swam back to
the dock.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, are you sure the snake didn't drop
into the water after you?" questioned Jessie, and
her face showed her anxiety.</p>

<p>"No, it retreated to the rocks further back,"
was the answer.</p>

<p>"Was it a poisonous snake?" asked Mrs. Basswood.</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know."</p>

<p>"If there are snakes in these woods I don't
think I'll care to go out very much," commented
Laura, with a shiver.</p>

<p>"Snakes will just spoil everything," added Jessie,
dismally.</p>

<p>While the boys and girls were dressing the report
of a shotgun rang out.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>"If that was Uncle Dunston shooting, he must
have found Mr. Snake," were Dave's words.</p>

<p>"I hope he did find the snake," answered
Roger. "If that reptile was left prowling
around in this vicinity, none of the ladies would
want to go out."</p>

<p>"And I wouldn't care much about going out
myself," added Luke.</p>

<p>Having finished dressing, the boys lost no time
in following Dunston Porter toward the rock
which had been the goal of the swimming race.
They found the old hunter and traveler searching
through the brushwood back of the rocks.</p>

<p>"Did you get it, Uncle Dunston?" questioned
Dave.</p>

<p>"I did," was the reply. "What's left of that
snake is over yonder," and Mr. Porter pointed
with his hand. "I'm looking around here to see
if there are any more of them, but I rather fancy
that is all there is."</p>

<p>The charge from the shotgun had fairly torn
the reptile to pieces, for when Dunston Porter had
fired the snake had been coiled up, evidently ready
for an attack.</p>

<p>Arming themselves with clubs and stones, the
boys joined Dunston Porter in the hunt for more
reptiles, but their search was unsuccessful; and a
little while later all returned to the bungalows.</p>

<p>"Did you find any other snakes?" asked Jessie,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>after she had been told about the one that had
been killed.</p>

<p>"No, and I don't think there are any others,"
answered Mr. Porter.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope there are not," put in Laura,
"but if there are I wish you had found them."</p>

<p>"We can't find what isn't there," said Luke,
with a grin.</p>

<p>"Say, that puts me in mind of a story," burst
out Shadow.</p>

<p>"Wow!" ejaculated Roger. "Here comes
another!"</p>

<p>"Oh, say! this is a good one," pleaded the
would-be story-teller. "It's about an old college
graduate who was a regular fiend for football.
He would undergo almost any hardship for the
sake of getting to a game. Well, one time there
was a great contest on between two of the big colleges,
and although old Bixby nearly broke his
back to get there, he didn't arrive until late.
'Say, how is it going?' he puffed to a gate-keeper.
'Nothing to nothing, middle of the second half,'
answered the gate-keeper. 'Is that so?' returned
old Bixby. 'That's good! I haven't missed anything,'
and he passed in." And at this anecdote
there was a general laugh.</p>

<p>In the afternoon while the young folks were
enjoying themselves in various ways around the
bungalows, they heard the put-put of a motor, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>looking out on Mirror Lake, saw the craft belonging
to the moving-picture company manager approaching,
loaded with the furniture that had been
borrowed.</p>

<p>"Here they come with our things!" cried Ben.
"Looks like a house moving; doesn't it?"</p>

<p>They saw that the boat was in sole charge
of Mr. Appleby, and as the craft drew closer
the moving-picture manager gave them a cheery
hail.</p>

<p>"Going into the moving business instead of
moving pictures, eh?" cried Dave.</p>

<p>"I thought I might as well bring this stuff back
while I had a chance," answered the manager, and
soon brought his motor-boat to a standstill beside
the dock. Then the boys made short work of
taking the furniture back to the bungalows.</p>

<p>"I've got news for you, Mr. Porter," announced
the moving-picture man, after the job
was finished. "I've seen that young rascal, Link
Merwell."</p>

<p>"You have!" exclaimed Dave, eagerly. "Up
at your camp?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"Did you make him a prisoner?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"I didn't get the chance. He was evidently on
his guard, and as soon as I told him what I knew,
and that I was going to hand him over to the
authorities, he ran straight into the woods, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>that was the last any of us saw of him. He even
left his suitcase and a light overcoat behind."</p>

<p>"Well, it's too bad he got away," returned our
hero. "I thought sure if he had the audacity to
show himself here we'd get a chance to capture
him."</p>

<p>"I was foolish not to make him a prisoner as
soon as he appeared," answered Thomas Appleby.
"But I didn't think he would run away in that
fashion, leaving his outfit behind. Besides, what
he'll do in the woods behind our camp is a mystery
to me. I asked old Tad Rason if there were any
roads back there, and he said not within a couple
of miles; so Merwell stands a good chance of losing
himself completely."</p>

<p>"Great Scott! Supposing he should get into
the woods and be unable to get out again!" burst
out Roger.</p>

<p>"Well, such things have happened," answered
Luke. "I heard only last winter of a man who
was lost in the Maine woods."</p>

<p>"Yes, and Tad Rason told of two brothers who
were lost up here in the Adirondacks for over
three weeks," returned Mr. Appleby. "When
they were found they were almost starved to death
and next door to crazy."</p>

<p>"If anything like that should happen to Link,
he will have nobody to blame but himself," announced
Roger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>"Did he know we were up here?" queried
Dave.</p>

<p>"He knew you were somewhere in this vicinity,
but he did not know that the camps were so close
to each other. I think if he had imagined such to
be the case he would have steered clear of this
vicinity."</p>

<p>"Was that young actor, Ward Porton, with
him?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know whether they came together
or not. Porton showed up about two
hours before Merwell arrived. Of course, they
may have separated just before the camp was
reached&mdash;Porton not wanting to appear in the
company of a fellow you had told him was a
crook."</p>

<p>"Is Porton at your camp now?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But he doesn't intend to stay very long.
He says he has something else in view, although
what it is I don't know. To tell you the truth,"
and Mr. Appleby lowered his voice a trifle, "I
think he is sweet on Miss Ford, and as she doesn't
care for him at all and has told him so, it has put
his nose out of joint."</p>

<p>"When you spoke to him about Merwell did
Porton stand up for the fellow?" continued our
hero. He was anxious to learn if possible just
how close the companionship of the pair had
been.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>"He didn't have much to say after I told him
all I knew," responded Thomas Appleby.
"Previous to that, he remarked that you might
be mistaken regarding Merwell&mdash;that Merwell
had said that Jasniff and somebody else were guilty
of the jewelry robbery."</p>

<p>"Humph! he can't put it off on anybody else
like that!" cried Phil. "We know beyond a
doubt that he and Jasniff committed that crime."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I ought not to blame Ward Porton
for sticking up for Merwell," answered Dave.
"Link is a mighty slick talker, and he probably
told his story to suit himself and got Porton to
swallow it. Just the same, Porton is very foolish
to chum with him."</p>

<p>"I'll be rather sorry to lose Porton, for he is
a clever fellow in the movies," went on the manager.
"He wanted to leave in a few days, but
I persuaded him to stay for a week at least, so we
could finish several dramas in which he is an actor.
After he is gone I'll have to get some one to take
his place. Any of you young fellows want to have
a try at it?" and Mr. Appleby looked full at
Dave.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," returned our hero, slowly.
And then he saw that Jessie's eyes were turned
upon him and that they showed she was troubled.
"I don't think I care to take the matter up. You
see, I came here for a rest and a good time."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>"I wouldn't mind taking a hand at it!" cried
Luke.</p>

<p>"You can count me in, too!" added Shadow.
"I'd like first-rate to see myself on the screen in
a moving-picture show," and his eyes lit up in anticipation.</p>

<p>"Well, you fellows come down some time and
we'll talk it over," concluded the manager. "I've
got to get back now. We are getting ready to
put on quite an important drama to-morrow, and
we have got to rehearse a number of scenes. If
you folks want to come up and look on, you'll be
welcome," he added, to the crowd in general.</p>

<p>When the moving-picture manager had departed,
the boys set out to fish along the brook
that flowed into Mirror Lake. While getting
ready for the sport the conversation drifted
around once more to Link Merwell.</p>

<p>"If he is in this vicinity, Dave, you can make
sure he'll try to get in on us somehow before he
leaves," remarked Phil.</p>

<p>"I don't see what he can do," returned Luke.</p>

<p>"Oh, a fellow like Link can do lots of things!"
burst out Ben. "Why, he might even try to burn
down the bungalows!"</p>

<p>"Do you think he's as bad as that?" questioned
Shadow.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do!" was the flat answer.</p>

<p>Fishing in the vicinity of the lake was not very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>good, so the boys pushed further and further up
the brook, until they reached a point where there
was a little waterfall and a pool of considerable
size. Here fishing was better, and soon they had
quite a number of specimens of the finny tribe to
their credit.</p>

<p>"Come on, Dave, let's go up a little farther,"
pleaded Phil. "I'd like to see what this brook
looks like beyond the falls."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll go," answered our hero.
"What about you fellows?" he asked, of the
others.</p>

<p>"I'll stay here and rest," announced Roger.
"I'm tired of scrambling over the rocks."</p>

<p>"So am I," agreed Ben. Shadow and Luke
also said they would remain in the vicinity of the
pool.</p>

<p>Dave and Phil found it no easy task to follow
the brook, which wound in and out among the
rocks and brushwood. At one point they had to
do some hard climbing, and once the shipowner's
son slipped and came close to spraining an ankle.</p>

<p>"Say, I don't believe I'll go much farther, after
all," declared Phil. "This is rough and no mistake!"</p>

<p>"It is better walking a little farther on, Phil,"
announced Dave. "Come on, don't give up this
way! Maybe we'll find some extra large fish up
there."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>Once more they set out, and soon found themselves
in a small clearing, backed up by a cliff fifteen
or twenty feet in height, and overgrown with
brushwood and trailing vines.</p>

<p>"Hark! What was that?" exclaimed Phil, as
both came to a halt preparatory to casting their
lines into the stream.</p>

<p>"I think it was a shout," answered Dave.
"Maybe the others are calling to us."</p>

<p>"No, I think the call came from up on the cliff,
Dave. Listen, there it is again!"</p>

<p>Both strained their ears and soon heard another
cry. This time it was much closer.</p>

<p>"Stop! stop! let me alone!" Such were the
words that floated to their ears. "Please don't
hit me! Let me alone!"</p>

<p>Dave and Phil looked at each other curiously.</p>

<p>"Who can it be?" questioned the shipowner's
son.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I guess we had better try
to find out," answered our hero.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<h2>THE CAPTURE OF LINK MERWELL</h2>
<br />

<p>"Where did that cry come from, Dave?"</p>

<p>"I think it came from the top of the cliff, Phil.
Listen! there it goes again."</p>

<p>Both boys strained their ears once more, and
now heard another voice, heavy and threatening.</p>

<p>"Leave this place! Leave at once, I command
you! No one has any right to disturb me!"</p>

<p>"Don't hit me, I'll go!" returned the one who
had first spoken, and a few seconds later he came
into view at the edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>"Hello, it's Link Merwell!" burst out Dave,
in amazement.</p>

<p>"Yes, and see, that wild man is after him!"
added the shipowner's son.</p>

<p>He was right. Following closely upon the appearance
of Link Merwell the boys at the foot of
the cliff had seen some brushwood thrust aside,
and now appeared the strange fellow who had so
frightened the girls some time previously. He
was dressed up more fantastically than ever, and
had his face smeared with red and yellow. Over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>his shoulder, suspended by a strap, he carried an
old-fashioned fowling piece, and in his hands was
a heavy club.</p>

<p>"Go away from here! Go away, I say, and
never come back!" cried the strange individual,
dancing around wildly and flourishing his club
close to Link Merwell's head.</p>

<p>"All right, I'm going! Please don't hit me!"
pleaded the youth, who was plainly in terror of
his life. And then, in his haste to escape, he took
several steps forward.</p>

<p>"Look out there, or you'll have a bad fall!"
yelled Dave, in quick alarm.</p>

<p>The warning, however, came too late. Deceived
by the brushwood and vines growing at the
edge of the cliff, Link Merwell lost his footing,
and the next instant came tumbling headlong.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! I told you to keep away! Now
don't come back!" yelled the fantastically-dressed
man in the bushes behind the cliff; and then with
another yell he suddenly disappeared from view.</p>

<p>Dave and Phil rushed forward fully expecting
to find Merwell seriously hurt. But in falling the
youth had been fortunate enough to catch hold of
some of the trailing vines, and these had stayed
his progress somewhat, so that all he received was
a violent shaking-up.</p>

<p>"Don&mdash;don't let&mdash;let him sho&mdash;shoot
me!" spluttered Link Merwell, as he turned over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>and scrambled to his feet. Then, for the first
time recognizing those who stood before him, his
face showed more concern than ever.</p>

<p>"Who's that fellow who attacked you, Link?"
asked Dave, quickly.</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;some crazy old lunatic, I suppose,"
muttered the former student of Oak Hall.
"Is he&mdash;he&mdash;coming after me?"</p>

<p>"No, he just dashed out of sight," answered
Phil. "He's the same chap who nearly scared
the girls to death," he added to Dave.</p>

<p>"How do you know? He didn't look like that
fellow," returned our hero.</p>

<p>"I recognized him by his voice, even though
he is dressed quite differently, Dave. He must be
as crazy as they make them."</p>

<p>"Oh, so you know him, do you?" put in Link
Merwell, questioningly. He had gotten to his
feet and was now straightening out his apparel.</p>

<p>"I must say, Link, I didn't think I was going
to have the pleasure of meeting you so soon," said
Dave, with a little bit of pardonable sarcasm.</p>

<p>"Humph!" Link Merwell was on the point
of saying more, but bit his lip and kept silent.</p>

<p>"So you were on board the steam yacht when
she took fire," put in Phil.</p>

<p>"I was."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you show yourself; were you
afraid?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>"That was my business. I didn't have to show
myself if I didn't want to."</p>

<p>"We know well enough why you didn't show
yourself, Link," broke in our hero. "And we
also know why you left Mr. Appleby's camp so
suddenly. You were afraid of arrest."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"Nobody told us. We know it," went on
Dave. "You have escaped several times, but I
guess we've got you now."</p>

<p>"Hi! don't you dare to touch me!" exclaimed
Link Merwell, in fresh alarm. "You haven't got
any right to put your hands on me."</p>

<p>"Right or wrong, Link, we are going to make
you a prisoner," declared Phil, and advancing he
caught the youth who had helped to rob Mr.
Wadsworth's jewelry works by the arm.</p>

<p>"You let me go, Phil Lawrence! If you don't
it will be the worse for you!" bawled Link, and
tried to wrench himself loose.</p>

<p>"Here, none of that!" broke in Dave, quickly,
and stepping forward, he caught the evildoer by
the other arm. "You just march along with
us!"</p>

<p>"I won't go!" bawled the boy who had gotten
himself into trouble. "Let go of me, I tell
you!"</p>

<p>He started to struggle, and for a minute or two
Dave and Phil had all they could do to hold him.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>Then, in sudden viciousness, Link kicked out, taking
Dave in the shin.</p>

<p>"Oh, so that's your game, is it?" cried Dave,
his anger rising. And then, as Link kicked out
once more, he caught the foot and gave the youth
a shove that sent him sprawling on his back. Before
Link could arise, Dave rushed in and sat
down heavily on him.</p>

<p>"Oh!" grunted the fallen one. "D-don't
cru-crush my ribs!" he panted. "L-let u-up!"</p>

<p>"I won't let up until you promise to behave
yourself," answered Dave, sternly. "For two
pins, Link, I'd give you the thrashing of your
life. You deserve it. What right had you to
send me that note and call me a 'poorhouse nobody'?"</p>

<p>"That's right, Dave. Pitch into him! Give
him what he deserves!" agreed Phil. "Maybe
a good licking would knock some common-sense
into him."</p>

<p>"D-don't you dare to&mdash;to t-touch me," panted
the boy under Dave. "If you&mdash;you do, I'll
ha-have the l-law on you!"</p>

<p>"Don't talk about the law!" cried Dave.
"The law will take care of you. When I caught
you down on Cave Island, and you said that you
were sorry that you had joined Jasniff in that robbery
and that you were going to reform, I felt
sorry for you. But you are a faker, Merwell, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>I don't believe you ever will reform, and that's
the reason I'm going to do my best now to place
you in the hands of the law."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;you let me u-up!"</p>

<p>"I won't let you up until you promise to behave
yourself and come along with us."</p>

<p>"A-all right, I pro-promise."</p>

<p>"Very well, then, you can get up," answered
Dave, arising. "But remember, you have given
us your word, and if you break it, I'll guarantee
that Phil and I will come down on you like a ton
of bricks. Now, if you know when you are well
off, you'll do exactly as we tell you to."</p>

<p>"I've got a scheme, Dave," broke in Phil,
bringing out an extra piece of fishline from his
pocket. "Let's tie his hands behind him with
this. Then I don't think he'll care to run away&mdash;not
very far, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Humph! can't you let me walk along without
having my hands tied?" grumbled the prisoner.</p>

<p>"We are not going to take any chances, Link,"
answered the shipowner's son. "Now that we
have caught you we are going to see that you get
where you belong&mdash;in prison."</p>

<p>"You send me to prison and my father will
make it hot for you!"</p>

<p>"You stop threatening us, Link!" ordered
Dave, sternly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>"All right. But you'll see!"</p>

<p>Much against his will, Link Merwell was
forced to place his hands behind him, and in a few
minutes Phil and Dave had secured the fishline
around his wrists. Then they picked up his cap,
which had fallen off, and placed it on his head.</p>

<p>"Now then, march!" ordered Dave. "And
no funny work!" And he led the way back along
the brook, with Merwell following and Phil bringing
up the rear with the fishing outfits.</p>

<p>"Say, how do you expect a fellow to get over
these rocks with his hands tied behind him?"
grumbled Link Merwell, after he had slipped several
times.</p>

<p>"You'll have to do the best you can," returned
Phil, coldly. "A jailbird like you can't expect
much consideration."</p>

<p>"Bah, you make me tired, Phil Lawrence!"
growled the prisoner. "I don't think you'll be
able to send me to prison; not for long, anyhow!
My father's got plenty of money; he'll get me out
some way."</p>

<p>"If he spends any money on you he'll be foolish,"
returned the shipowner's son. "Now go
ahead, we are not going to waste all our time on
you."</p>

<p>It was not long after this when they came in
sight of the other boys. Ben and Roger were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>still fishing, while Luke and Shadow were resting
on the rocks, the latter telling one of his favorite
stories.</p>

<p>"Hello! What luck?" called Ben, looking
up. And then he added: "Great C&aelig;sar's ghost!
if it isn't Link Merwell!"</p>

<p>"Where did you run across him?" cried Luke,
leaping to his feet, followed by Shadow.</p>

<p>"We found him running away from some kind
of a wild man," answered Dave.</p>

<p>"The wild man who scared us into fits the other
day?" queried Roger.</p>

<p>"We don't know if it was that fellow or somebody
else," answered Phil.</p>

<p>Link Merwell was much crestfallen to confront
so many of his former schoolmates of Oak Hall.
He realized that he was "in the camp of the
enemy" in more ways than one. At one time or
another he had played each of them some sort of
a scurvy trick, and he realized that not one of
them would have a good word to say for him.</p>

<p>"Well, I see they have made you a prisoner,"
remarked Luke, as he noticed that Link's hands
were tied behind him.</p>

<p>"Humph! they had no right to do it," growled
the prisoner. "Where are you going to take me,
anyhow?"</p>

<p>"We are going to take you to our bungalows,"
announced Dave. "There you will have the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>pleasure of talking the matter over with Mr.
Wadsworth."</p>

<p>At the mention of the name of the man he had
robbed, Link Merwell winced and his face paled.
Evidently he did not relish what was in store for
him.</p>

<p>"Say, having his hands tied behind him puts
me in mind of a story," began Shadow. "Once
there was a fellow&mdash;&mdash;" and then, as the
would-be story teller saw a look of disgust coming
over the faces of his chums, he added hastily:
"Oh, well, never mind. I'll tell you that story
some other time."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Wadsworth staying up here with
you?" asked Link, while Ben and the others prepared
to return to the bungalows.</p>

<p>"He is," answered Dave.</p>

<p>"Is his family with him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we are all up here for a short vacation."
Dave looked at his enemy squarely in the eyes.
"Link, do you think you are treating me just
right? I never put a straw in your way, and yet
you have done everything you could to make
things unpleasant for me. I tried to help you
down on Cave Island, and in return for that you
have been sending letters to Nat Poole asking him
to help you in hurting me. And then the other
day you sent that note calling me a 'poorhouse
nobody.'"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>"Oh, don't preach to me, Dave Porter!"
growled the youth who had been made a prisoner.
"I hate that kind of talk. You always tried to
set yourself up as being better than any one else.
Maybe you could get on the soft side of Gus
Plum, but you can't play any such game as that on
me. I know what I am doing."</p>

<p>"Link, I'm sorry to hear you talk that way,"
went on Dave, earnestly. "Do you want to
spend all your life in prison?"</p>

<p>"Bah, don't talk to me! Didn't I tell you I
don't want any preaching? If I've got to go to
jail I'll go, but it won't be for long, mark my
words! My father has got lots of money, and
I guess the lawyers will know what to do. But
let me tell you something, Dave Porter"&mdash;and
now Link Merwell's face showed both cunning
and hatred&mdash;"you found fault with that note I
sent to you calling you a poorhouse nobody.
Well, that is all you are; a poorhouse nobody!"</p>

<p>"See here, Link&mdash;&mdash;" began our hero, his
temper rising.</p>

<p>"Oh, now, just wait, Dave Porter! Just wait
a little, and you'll find out what I mean. You
are a poorhouse nobody and nothing else. Dave
Porter? Why, you are not Dave Porter at all!
You are a poorhouse nobody; that's all you are!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h2>BACK IN CAMP</h2>
<br />

<p>"What's this you are saying, Link?" demanded
Phil, who had overheard the conversation
just recorded. "You ought to be ashamed of
yourself to talk that way. Just because Dave
spent part of his life in the poorhouse after he
was stolen away from his parents is no reason why
you should speak as you do."</p>

<p>"And that isn't the reason why I am talking
this way," retorted the prisoner. "I've got another
reason, and Dave Porter will find out what
it is before very long."</p>

<p>"You just said that I was not Dave Porter,"
remarked our hero. "What do you mean by
that?"</p>

<p>"Never mind what I mean; you'll find out
sooner or later," answered Link, with an expression
of cunning on his countenance.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't listen to him!" broke in Roger;
"he is only trying to worry you, Dave. Let us
get back to the bungalows and tell Mr. Wadsworth
about this capture."</p>

<p>"I'm not going back with you," retorted Link
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>Merwell. And now, with his hands tied behind
him, he made a leap over the rocks in the direction
of the woods.</p>

<p>The sudden movement on the part of the prisoner,
surrounded as he was by all of the boys,
came somewhat as a surprise. But Dave, Roger
and Phil were quick to recover, and away they
bounded in pursuit of the fleeing one.</p>

<p>Terror lent speed to Link Merwell's feet, and
soon he gained the edge of the growth, which at
this point was quite heavy.</p>

<p>"Hurry up or he'll hide himself!" called
Dave, who was in advance of his chums.</p>

<p>The runaway might have made good his escape
had it not been for the fact that his hands were
so tightly bound behind him. As he dashed between
the first of the trees, his foot caught on an
outcropping root. Unable to throw out his hands
to save himself, he came down heavily, striking
his forehead on another tree root.</p>

<p>"I've got him, come on!" cried Dave, and in
a few seconds more was beside the fallen one.
To his surprise Link Merwell lay motionless.</p>

<p>"Collar him! don't let him get away again!"
yelled Roger, as he came up with Phil beside him.</p>

<p>"I think he hurt himself when he fell," answered
our hero. "How about it, Link?" and
he bent over his enemy as he asked the question.</p>

<p>There was no reply, and getting down on their
knees, the three boys raised Link Merwell up and
turned him over. He was unconscious, and the
blood was flowing from a cut on his left temple.</p>

<div class="img"><a name="imagep202" id="imagep202"></a>
<a href="images/imagep202.jpg">
<img border="0" src="images/imagep202.jpg" width="45%" alt="You just said that I was not Dave Porter" /></a><br />
<p class="cen" style="margin-top: .2em; margin-left: 20%; margin-right: 20%;">"<span class="smcap">You just said that I was not Dave Porter," remarked our
hero. "What do you mean by that?"</span>&mdash;<i>Page 201.</i><span class="totoi"><a href="#toi">ToList</a></span></p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>"He came down pretty hard, I imagine," said
Dave. "Let us carry him down to the brook."</p>

<p>Not without some difficulty, the three lads
raised the unconscious form and carried it toward
the brook, meeting the other boys on the way.</p>

<p>"Hello! what did you do; sock him one?"
queried Luke.</p>

<p>"No, he fell, and as he couldn't use his hands
he hit his head on a tree root," answered Dave.
"Get a little water, somebody, and we'll see if we
can revive him."</p>

<p>The water was soon brought, and with this they
washed off the wound, after which they bound up
Link Merwell's head with several handkerchiefs.
The sufferer groaned and gasped several times,
and finally opened and closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Say, he may be hurt worse than we think,"
remarked Roger, gravely.</p>

<p>"I guess he ought to have a doctor," added
Dave. "But where to get one around here I
don't know. I don't believe there is one at
Carpen Falls."</p>

<p>"I know there isn't, because I heard my mother
asking about it," added Ben. "But I think we
ought to get him down to the bungalows."</p>

<p>All of the boys were agreed that this was the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>best thing to do, and so, after putting up their fishing
outfit, they began the return to the lake shore,
taking turns at carrying the unconscious youth.</p>

<p>"O dear! who is hurt?" cried Laura, as she
saw the party approaching.</p>

<p>"It's Link Merwell," answered her brother.
"Call Mr. Wadsworth; will you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave! so you've caught him; have you?"
cried Jessie, while Laura ran off on her errand.
"Did you have a fight?"</p>

<p>"Not much of a one, Jessie. He got hurt
through a fall."</p>

<p>"What a very foolish boy he has been!" was
Belle's comment. "But I think his father is
partly to blame. He always allowed Link to do
as he pleased on the ranch, and when Link went
to the city he always gave him more spending
money than was good for him, at least, so my
father said."</p>

<p>"It was up to Link to do the square thing on
his own account," broke in Roger. "He had all
the chance in the world to make a man of himself.
But he preferred the company of fellows like
Jasniff. And this is the result."</p>

<p>Mr. Wadsworth was in his bungalow writing a
letter. He was surprised and gratified at the
news brought by Laura, and quickly followed her
outside. A little later Mrs. Wadsworth and
Mrs. Basswood joined the group. The boys had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>unbound Link, and now they placed him on a
large hammock with a comfortable pillow under
his head. As the jewelry manufacturer approached,
the sufferer opened his eyes and then
struggled to sit up.</p>

<p>"Hello! I guess he isn't hurt as much as we
thought," remarked Shadow, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Maybe he's only playing 'possum," was
Luke's comment.</p>

<p>"No, he was hurt, that's sure; the cut on his
forehead shows it," answered Dave.</p>

<p>"Well, Merwell, so they have caught you;
have they?" began Mr. Wadsworth, as he
stepped up in front of the youth. "I thought we
would get you sooner or later."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't talk to you no-now," faltered the
prisoner.</p>

<p>"I don't think it will be necessary to do much
talking, Merwell," went on the jewelry manufacturer.
"We can do our talking later&mdash;possibly
in the police court."</p>

<p>"All right, have your own way about it,"
growled the prisoner. "You've got me and I'm
down and out, so you can do your worst." And
with this he rolled over on the hammock once
more and again closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Talk about nerve!" whispered Ben.
"Doesn't that take the cake!"</p>

<p>"I'd like to know whether he is really hurt so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>much, or only shamming," added Phil. "He always
was a sly one."</p>

<p>"Tell me how you came to capture him," said
Mr. Wadsworth.</p>

<p>Thereupon Dave and Phil related how they had
gone up the brook to the vicinity of the cliff, and
there heard the words between Link and the so-called
wild man.</p>

<p>"O dear! is that awful creature around here
again?" cried Jessie.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Dave. "And I wish he
would keep away."</p>

<p>Then Dave and Phil related how Link Merwell
had plunged over the cliff and had been made a
prisoner, and then how, later on, he had tried to
escape, struck his head on the tree root, and how
all of the boys had brought him to the bungalows.</p>

<p>"I am glad he didn't get away from you," said
Oliver Wadsworth. "I think he ought to be in
prison to keep Jasniff company."</p>

<p>"How will you get him to jail?" questioned
Phil.</p>

<p>"I don't know what we can do except to march
him down to Carpen Falls. But we can't do that
to-day, for he seems too weak. Perhaps we can
take him down there to-morrow, or else some of
us can go down and get an officer to come up here
and take charge of him."</p>

<p>The matter was talked over at some length, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>it was finally decided that nothing more should be
done that day. Link Merwell did not join in the
discussion, nor even open his eyes to look at them.
But by close observation, Dave became satisfied
that the prisoner was listening intently to every
word that was said.</p>

<p>"What will you do with him to-night?" asked
Roger.</p>

<p>"We might lock him up in one of the rooms in
the bungalow," suggested Dave.</p>

<p>"I don't think we'll give up one of our rooms
to that fellow!" put in Mr. Wadsworth. "I
think a bunk in the woodshed will be plenty good
enough for him."</p>

<p>"Oh, Pa, wouldn't that be rather hard on
him?" questioned Jessie, who did not want to see
even a rascal like Merwell suffer physical discomfort.</p>

<p>"I dare say he has been putting up with worse
than that in the woods here and while he was on
Cave Island and in the far West," returned her
father. "We'll place an old couch and some
blankets in a corner of the shed, and that will be
plenty good enough for him."</p>

<p>"But somebody will have to watch him," answered
Dave. "I'll do it if you want me to."</p>

<p>"That wouldn't be quite fair, Dave," broke in
Phil. "If he has got to be watched, let us take
turns at doing it."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>"We might bind him fast to the cot," suggested
Mr. Wadsworth.</p>

<p>"He's so slick I'd be afraid to risk that," answered
Dave. "I'll not mind staying up watching
him."</p>

<p>"Let us all take a hand at it," broke in Ben.
"Every fellow can go on guard-duty for two
hours, and call the next fellow." And so, after a
little discussion, the matter was arranged.</p>

<p>"I suppose I'm not to have anything to eat?"
grumbled Link Merwell, a little later, when they
were arranging to place him in the woodshed,
which was a small lean-to of the Wadsworth
bungalow. This place was used for the storage
of firewood, but just now was almost empty.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, we'll see to it that you get something
to eat," answered Mrs. Wadsworth, quickly.</p>

<p>"I haven't had a square meal for twenty-four
hours," went on the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Give him all he wants, but nothing fancy,"
said Mr. Wadsworth. "He deserves nothing but
the plainest kind of victuals."</p>

<p>"Where have you kept yourself since you ran
away from Mr. Appleby's camp?" questioned
Phil, curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I just roamed around in the woods," was
the somewhat sullen answer.</p>

<p>"Did you meet that wild man more than
once?" questioned Roger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>"No. If it hadn't been for that fellow, whoever
he is, you wouldn't have caught me," added
Link, bitterly.</p>

<p>"I wonder what the Pooles will do when Mr.
Basswood tells them what we think, that it is Mr.
Wilbur Poole," came from Dave. "Perhaps
they will send some of the sanitarium authorities
up to try to catch him."</p>

<p>"I hope they do catch him!" came from Jessie.
"I'll never feel safe as long as that man is at
large."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h2>THE ESCAPE</h2>
<br />

<p>Mr. Dunston Porter had been down to Carpen
Falls for a walk and to get the mail. He returned
late that evening, bringing several letters
with him. He was of course much surprised to
learn of the capture of Link Merwell, and listened
with interest to the details concerning the affair.</p>

<p>Among the letters which his uncle had brought
along was one for Dave, which he read with deep
interest. It was from Nat Poole, who evidently
had not yet heard anything regarding his missing
uncle.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I want to tell you of what has happened here
lately," (wrote Nat). "I have received two
visits from a young fellow named Ward Porton,
who is, I believe, a moving-picture actor, and the
same fellow that you helped to rescue from a burning
steam yacht. This fellow was in town once
with Link Merwell, and then came here alone.
He has been visiting a number of people who are
well acquainted with you, and also visited the
poorhouse here and talked to several of those in
authority, and those who used to have the running
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>of the poorhouse years ago, when you were an
inmate there. This Ward Porton acted as if he
had something of great importance on his mind,
but what it was he would not tell, but he did let
slip that it was something concerning you&mdash;that
there was a big surprise in store for you. He also
let slip that he, too, had been in a poorhouse when
he was a little boy, and that he had never been
able to learn where he had really come from.</p>

<p>"I am writing this to put you on your guard
in case he should show himself either at your camp
or at the Wadsworth mansion after your return.
I must confess that I don't like the fellow's manner,
and I rather surmise he is laying pipes to play
you some trick."</p></div>

<p>Dave read this letter over several times, and
was much perplexed. He had not forgotten what
Link Merwell had said to him shortly after being
captured, nor had he forgotten the fact that he
had seen Link and Ward Porton in Crumville at
the old Potts farm.</p>

<p>"Those fellows are certainly up to something,"
our hero told himself. "Link said that I was not
Dave Porter. Now, what did he mean by that?
Those fellows must be hatching up some plot
against me."</p>

<p>"Dave, you look rather worried," remarked
Phil, as he caught the youth reading the communication
for the third time. "No bad news I
hope?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>"I can't tell whether it is or not, Phil," was the
reply. And Dave handed the letter to his chum.</p>

<p>"Phew! This looks like a mystery," was the
comment of the shipowner's son. "Dave, do
you think this had anything to do with what Link
Merwell said when we caught him&mdash;that you
were not Dave Porter?"</p>

<p>"That's the way it looks to me, Phil."</p>

<p>"But that's rank nonsense. We all know you
are Dave Porter."</p>

<p>"Well, I've always thought I was Dave Porter,
ever since I met my Uncle Dunston out in those
South Sea Islands."</p>

<p>"Why of course you are! Don't you look just
like your Uncle Dunston? This is some game,
Dave."</p>

<p>"I think so myself."</p>

<p>"What are you fellows confabbing about?"
asked Roger, walking up.</p>

<p>"We're talking about a letter I just received,"
answered Dave. And then the senator's son also
read the communication.</p>

<p>"Say, this is a mystery and no mistake!" was
Roger's comment. "And so Nat thinks that
Ward Porton is mixed up in it, eh? That is
strange."</p>

<p>"What do you suppose he has to do with it,
Roger?" questioned Phil.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>"I am sure I don't know. But come to think
of it, he did look like&mdash;&mdash;" And then Roger
broke off in confusion.</p>

<p>"Look like what, Roger?" asked Dave,
quickly.</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind, Dave, let's drop the subject
and talk about what we are going to do with Link
Merwell."</p>

<p>"I think I know what you were going to say,"
went on our hero, and he tried to speak calmly although
his heart gave a sudden jump. "You
were going to say that Ward Porton looked
like my Uncle Dunston and like me."</p>

<p>"Well, if you must know it, Dave, that is what
did come into my mind. I don't think he resembles
you quite as much as he resembles your
uncle, to be really honest."</p>

<p>"Oh, say, Roger, drop that!" interposed Phil,
hastily. "I think Dave looks a good deal
more like his uncle than Porton looks like Mr.
Porter."</p>

<p>"It's a queer mystery, that's certain," returned
Dave, slowly. "I don't like it, I must say," and
his face showed more concern than it had for a
long while.</p>

<p>"Don't you take this too seriously, Dave!"
cried Roger. "I believe at the most it's only
some game gotten up by Link Merwell. Now
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>that we have him a prisoner and can send him to
jail for that robbery, more than likely you won't
hear anything further about it."</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope you speak the truth," was
our hero's sober reply.</p>

<p>After a plain but substantial meal, Link Merwell
was taken to the woodshed and told he would
have to remain there until morning. Then the
boys cast lots to find out who should go on guard
first.</p>

<p>"I'm number one," announced Phil, after drawing
one of a number of slips of paper placed in a
cap.</p>

<p>"And I follow you," announced Luke.</p>

<p>"I'm guard number three," came from Ben, and
the other boys announced what slips they had
drawn.</p>

<p>Usually the woodshed was dark, but now a lantern
had been hung on a nail to illuminate the
place. There were two doors, one connecting
with the bungalow proper, and the other leading
into the backyard of the place. There was also
a small window, over which in times past several
stout wooden bars had been nailed to keep out
prowling wild animals.</p>

<p>"Think I'll run away, eh?" remarked Link
Merwell, as he sat down on the couch which had
been placed in the woodshed.</p>

<p>"You'll not get the chance," returned Phil, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>had armed himself with one of the double-barreled
shotguns. "If you try to get away, Link, you'll
get a dose of shot in you, just as sure as fate."</p>

<p>"Humph! I don't think I'll want to run
away," grumbled the prisoner. "There is no
place to run to in this forsaken section of the country.
What you folks can find here to make it
pleasant is a mystery to me."</p>

<p>The door leading to the outside had been closed
and bolted. The other door leading to the bungalow
proper was left open for ventilation, and Phil
sat on a low stool beside it, with the shotgun across
his knees.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure you can manage him,
Phil?" questioned Mr. Wadsworth, as he came
to the doorway after the others in both bungalows
had retired.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can manage him easily enough," returned
the shipowner's son. "I've got this, you
see," and he tapped the shotgun suggestively.</p>

<p>"Well, don't have any shooting unless it becomes
absolutely necessary," answered the jewelry
manufacturer; and then he, too, retired.</p>

<p>For a short while Link Merwell lay down on the
couch and turned over as if to go to sleep. But he
was restless, and presently, when all was quiet, he
turned over again and sat up.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do with me when you
get me to Carpen Falls?" he questioned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>"We are going to hand you over to the authorities."</p>

<p>"Is Dave Porter going along to the Falls?"</p>

<p>"I don't know about that. That's for Mr.
Wadsworth to say," answered Phil. "By the
way," he continued, "what did you mean by telling
Dave that he was not Dave Porter?"</p>

<p>"Never you mind, you'll find out soon enough,"
grumbled the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Very well, Link, if you don't want to tell me
you don't have to. Just the same, if you are trying
to hatch out some plot against Dave, I warn
you to be careful. He has stood about as much
as he intends to stand."</p>

<p>"This is no plot; this is something real,"
grumbled Link Merwell. "Just you wait, that's
all," and then he lay down on the couch once more
and pretended to go to sleep.</p>

<p>At the proper time Luke came to relieve Phil,
and was followed by Ben, and then by Shadow.</p>

<p>"Say, it's cold to-night," remarked the former
story-teller of Oak Hall, as he took the shotgun
and sat down on the stool. "If this weather
keeps on, before long we'll have frost up here,
and we'll all be thinking of going home."</p>

<p>"Better put on an extra coat; here is one," answered
Ben, and passed the garment over. Then
he returned to the other bungalow, for he was
tired.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>Shadow had expected to have quite a talk with
the prisoner, but in this he was disappointed, for
Link appeared to be asleep, and he did not have
the heart to awaken the prisoner. He sat on the
stool, thinking over several of the stories he had
told from time to time, and trying to invent one or
two new ones.</p>

<p>In the midst of his revery a sound from outside
startled him. It was the hooting of an owl, and
so close that the mournful sound made Shadow
shiver.</p>

<p>"I'd like to shoot that owl," he told himself, as
the hooting continued. "If I brought him down I
could have him stuffed," he thought, with some
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Shadow looked at the motionless form on the
couch, and then arising from the stool, tiptoed his
way into the big living-room of the bungalow.
One of the windows was wide open, and he looked
out of this to see if he could locate the owl. The
hooting was now closer than before and seemed to
come from a tree not twenty-five feet away.</p>

<p>"Say, there's a chance for a shot," murmured
the youth to himself. "If I could only spot that
owl I'm sure I could&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Thump! Shadow received a staggering blow
in the back of the neck, and then felt himself
hurled to one side, while the shotgun was wrenched
from his grasp. Then, before he could recover
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>from his astonishment, a figure leaped through
the open window and dashed across the moonlit
dooryard.</p>

<p>"Hi! Stop!" yelled Shadow, as soon as he
could recover his breath. "Stop! Help!"</p>

<p>"What's the racket?" The cry came from
Roger, and then he and Dave burst into the room,
followed by Phil.</p>

<p>"Merwell! He's escaped! He got the gun
away from me, and jumped through the window!"
panted poor Shadow. "Oh, what a fool I was to
think he was asleep!"</p>

<p>"Where did he go?" questioned Dave, and at
the same time bounded back into the bedroom, to
don his shoes and part of his clothing.</p>

<p>"He jumped out of the window with the gun.
That's all I know about it," answered Shadow.</p>

<p>"Didn't you have a fight?" questioned Phil.</p>

<p>"No, I came to the window to look at an owl
that was hooting around here. Link came behind
me and gave me a fierce crack in the neck. Then
he grabbed the gun and went through the window
like a flash. And I thought he was asleep!"</p>

<p>By this time Dave had returned, partly dressed,
and catching up another one of the fowling pieces
in the bungalow he, too, leaped through the window,
followed by Shadow. A few seconds later
the other boys joined them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>"Have you any idea which way he went?"
questioned our hero.</p>

<p>"I don't know exactly, Dave, but I think he
went that way," and the former story-teller of Oak
Hall pointed with his hand.</p>

<p>"Let's scatter a little," ordered Dave, and
while he passed in the direction pointed out, the
other boys separated to both sides of him. All
advanced to the edge of the woods and there came
to a halt. While the moon made it fairly bright
in the open space surrounding the bungalows, beneath
the trees it was dark, and consequently little
could be seen.</p>

<p>"Might as well look for a pin in a haystack,"
grumbled Roger. "If he got into these woods it's
good-bye to him. We might search all night and
not get a trace of the rascal."</p>

<p>"I guess you're right, Roger," answered Dave,
"but let's search around a little anyway."</p>

<p>Long before this the alarm had become general,
and now Dunston Porter and Mr. Wadsworth
appeared, followed shortly by Mrs. Wadsworth
and Mrs. Basswood and the girls.</p>

<p>"Let us take the flashlights and lanterns and see
if we can't get on the track of him," ordered the
jewelry manufacturer. "We must capture him if
it is possible to do so."</p>

<p>And then the search began in earnest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h2>MORE OF A MYSTERY</h2>
<br />

<p>"Did you see anything of him?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing. Did you?"</p>

<p>"I saw something move under the trees, but I
guess it was a wild animal."</p>

<p>"He's gotten away, and that is all there is to
it," said Dave, as he looked at his chums and at
the men, who had also joined in the search for
Link Merwell.</p>

<p>"This is certainly too bad!" remarked Mr.
Wadsworth, with a shake of his head.</p>

<p>"And it was all my fault!" broke out Shadow,
bitterly. "Oh, I could kick myself full of holes
every time I think of it!"</p>

<p>Over an hour had been spent in the woods surrounding
the clearing on Mirror Lake. During
that time the men and the boys had stirred up several
small wild animals, but that had been all.</p>

<p>"He must have legged it for all he was worth
after he jumped through the window," was Roger's
comment. "For all we know he may be miles
away from here by now."</p>

<p>"If he ran straight into those woods it was a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>hazardous proceeding," said Dunston Porter.
"He'll become hopelessly lost in the darkness, and
when daylight comes he won't know how to turn
to get out."</p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps he'll climb a tree and locate his
surroundings that way," suggested Dave. "You
must remember that Link isn't like a city fellow.
He was brought up in the wild West, and knows
how to do for himself in the open."</p>

<p>"We may as well give up the hunt," said Mr.
Wadsworth, and turned toward Bear Camp, followed
by the others.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, did you catch him?" The cry
came from Jessie, who stood on the porch with the
others, awaiting their return.</p>

<p>"No, he got away."</p>

<p>"That's too bad!"</p>

<p>"You should have kept him bound, Dave," said
Laura.</p>

<p>"That's it, Dave," added Belle. "In the West
they would tie a rascal like Link fast to a tree with
a lariat. If you secured him properly he would
stay there until you freed him."</p>

<p>"Well, there is no use in crying over spilt milk,"
remarked Mrs. Basswood. "I suppose we may
as well go to bed again." And on this the others
agreed.</p>

<p>Several days, including Sunday, passed, and
nothing more was seen or heard of Link Merwell
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>or Ward Porton. During that time the young
folks went out on the lake several times, and also
went fishing. Swimming was mentioned, but as
the weather was getting colder rapidly, only Dave
and Phil went in for a plunge. One day they
planned to visit the moving-picture people, but it
rained and they did not go.</p>

<p>"It will soon be time for hunting," announced
Roger. "I hope we do get a chance to bring
down something before we have to go back."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to have a crack at a deer, myself,"
answered Dave, who had not forgotten the
sport he had had on Squirrel Island and at other
places in the vicinity of Oak Hall.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with a crack at a bear?"
interposed Phil. "A great big shaggy fellow that
would weigh eight hundred or a thousand pounds."</p>

<p>"Say, Phil, you don't want much in life!" cried
Ben. "Why don't you make it a two-thousand-pound
bear while you are at it?"</p>

<p>"Say, speaking about heavy bears puts me in
mind of a story I heard!" cried Shadow, his face
lighting up for the first time since the escape of
Link Merwell. "This yarn was told by an old
western hunter and trapper, and he said it was
strictly true. He said he was out on the ranges
one day when he found himself suddenly pursued
by three Modoc Indians. He shot at them several
times without hitting anybody, and then, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>his consternation, he found that his ammunition
had given out. He legged it up a mountain-side,
and the three Modocs came after him, yelling to
beat the band. Just as they were following him
up the steep trail, he saw a monstrous bear come
plunging out from a thicket near by. He was so
upset that he hardly knew what to do, but he
grabbed up a big rock and sent it at the bear. It
struck the monstrous animal on the head and
keeled him over, and the bear rolled down the
steep mountain-side, and knocked over the three
Modoc Indians, smashing every one of them."</p>

<p>"Wow! That's some bear story!" exclaimed
Luke.</p>

<p>"Shadow, how could you bear to tell such a
story?" asked Dave, reproachfully.</p>

<p>"That knocks out all the dime novels ever written,"
said Ben.</p>

<p>"Why, Ben! do you mean to say you have read
them all?" cried our hero, in pretended surprise.</p>

<p>"All? I don't read any of them!" snorted
Ben. "Just the same, that's the biggest whopper
I ever heard."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not vouching for the story," interposed
Shadow, dryly, "I'm just telling it as it was
told to me."</p>

<p>"Speaking about being frightened by a bear puts
me in mind that it's queer we haven't seen or heard
anything more of that wild man," remarked Roger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>"We don't want to see or hear anything more
of him!" burst out Laura. "One scare was
enough."</p>

<p>"It's queer that the Pooles don't send some one
up here to look for him," remarked Jessie. "If
he were my uncle I certainly wouldn't want him to
be roaming around in the woods that way."</p>

<p>"If he is just roaming around I wonder how he
manages to live," said Dave. "And where does
he get all that outlandish outfit?"</p>

<p>"He must have some sort of a habitation here,"
returned Phil. "Maybe he has taken possession
of some bungalow or cabin that was locked up.
If he has, won't the owners of the place be mad
when they find it out, especially if he is using their
things!"</p>

<p>"I wonder if we couldn't go up to that cliff and
track him in some way from there?" said Phil.
"He may have left some sort of trail behind him.
Unless he follows some kind of paths through the
woods he would be apt to get lost, just like anybody
else."</p>

<p>"If he really is Wilbur Poole, I'd like to capture
him and send him back to the sanitarium;
where he belongs," remarked Roger. "I think
Nat would like us to do it."</p>

<p>"What do you say about starting on a regular
hunt to-morrow?" asked Dave. "We might go
out directly after breakfast and carry our lunch
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>with us. Who knows but what in looking for the
wild man we might run across some trace of Link
Merwell."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, you mustn't get into any trouble!"
cried Jessie, hastily.</p>

<p>"If we go out we'll go armed and be on our
guard," he replied.</p>

<p>The matter was talked over for some time, and
at last it was decided that the boys should start out
in a body directly after breakfast the following
morning, provided it remained clear. They were
to carry a shotgun and a rifle, and also a substantial
lunch, and were not to return to Bear Camp until
evening.</p>

<p>"I'd like to go on such a tramp myself," announced
Belle. "It would be lots of fun climbing
over the rocks and up the mountains."</p>

<p>"I think you girls had better remain around the
bungalows," said Mrs. Wadsworth. "You can
go out some other time, when the boys are not
looking for that wild man and Link Merwell."</p>

<p>During the past few days those at Bear Camp
had seen but little of the moving-picture company.
That afternoon the old hunter, Tad Rason,
stopped at the dock in his rowboat, and made the
announcement that the company had gone to the
other end of the lake, to take pictures for several
more dramas.</p>

<p>"Mr. Appleby wanted me to tell you that that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>young feller, Ward Porton, ain't goin' to be with
'em no more," announced Tad Rason to Dave.
"He says the young feller writ a letter sayin' that
he was on the track of his parentage, and he
guessed as how he'd have plenty of money of his
own when he could prove who he was."</p>

<p>This announcement was of great interest to
Dave, and he immediately questioned Tad Rason,
to learn if the old hunter knew anything further.
But that was all Rason could tell. He even did
not know how long Ward Porton had remained
with the moving-picture company after his arrival
in the Adirondacks.</p>

<p>"The huntin' season will be openin' to-morrow,"
announced Tad Rason, in reply to a question
from Phil. "I'm bound down the lake now to
meet a party of hunters comin' from Albany. I
take 'em out every season, actin' as guide."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'll get you to go out with us some
day," said Roger.</p>

<p>"All right, boys. I'll be glad to go, if I ain't
got any job with them other fellows," announced
the old hunter.</p>

<p>Although he was not willing to admit it to the
others, Dave was greatly worried over the news
brought by Tad Rason. Coupling it with what he
had heard from Link Merwell and Nat Poole, he
could reach but one conclusion, which was that in
some way Ward Porton was going to try to prove
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>that the boy from the Crumville poorhouse was
not the real Dave Porter.</p>

<p>"Maybe he'll come along with a story that he
is the real Dave," thought our hero, bitterly.
"He said he was raised in a poorhouse, just like
myself, but he also said it was away down East
and not anywhere near the vicinity of Crumville.
How he is going to get around that is beyond me.
I don't think he'll be able to make anybody believe
his story. Just the same, I wish this thing hadn't
come up. I'd like to forget those poorhouse days
entirely." And at the remembrance of those bitter
times, Dave sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"Dave, you look awfully worried," said Jessie,
that evening when the boys were getting ready for
their next day's tramp. "What is the trouble?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't much," he answered, evasively.
"I was just thinking over what Link Merwell
said."</p>

<p>"Dave, don't let him worry you so!" cried the
girl, sympathetically. "He is a bad boy, and
everybody knows it."</p>

<p>"But he said some things that I don't like at
all, Jessie. I don't like him to call me a poorhouse
nobody."</p>

<p>"Dave, don't you mind him! I don't care if
you did come from the poorhouse. I think just as
much of you anyway," and Jessie's eyes showed her
earnestness.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>"It's splendid of you to say that," he returned,
in a low tone, and catching both her hands, he
squeezed them tightly. "It's a grand good thing
to have somebody who believes in you."</p>

<p>Early in the evening there was a slight shower,
and some of the boys thought they were in for a
steady rain. But soon the clouds passed, and the
moon and stars came out as brightly as ever.</p>

<p>"A perfect day!" announced Roger, on arising
the next morning. "Just cool enough to make
mountain climbing a pleasure."</p>

<p>The servants had an early breakfast ready for
the boys, and by the time the girls and the others
appeared they had partaken of the repast and were
ready to depart. Dave carried the rifle and Roger
the shotgun, while the others were loaded down
with several knapsacks of provisions and some
extra wraps and a blanket or two.</p>

<p>"You want to take plenty of things with you,"
Dunston Porter had cautioned them. "You may
get farther away from home than you anticipate,
and may have to stay out all night."</p>

<p>"That's true, Uncle Dunston," Dave had answered.
"And that being so, if we don't turn up
at a reasonable hour, don't worry about us."</p>

<p>"But what will you do if you capture that wild
man?" asked Mrs. Basswood.</p>

<p>"If it's Wilbur Poole, we'll make him a prisoner
and bring him with us," announced Dave.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>"Well, good luck to you!" cried Dunston Porter,
as the boys prepared to leave. "Remember
the hunting season opens to-day, so if you get a
chance at any game don't let it slip you."</p>

<p>"Trust us for that, Uncle Dunston!" cried
Dave.</p>

<p>With shouts of good-bye, the boys turned away
from the bungalows, and a few minutes later disappeared
along the path running beside the brook.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h2>SHOOTING A WILDCAT</h2>
<br />

<p>Less than half an hour later, the boys found
themselves at the top of the cliff where Dave and
Phil had seen the encounter between Link
Merwell and the so-called wild man. A brief look
around convinced them that the locality was deserted.</p>

<p>"Now to find the wild man's trail, if he left
one," announced Dave, and the boys scattered in
several directions, looking at the ground and the
brushwood with great care.</p>

<p>"If we only had one of those Reservation Indians
with us, he might help us pick up the trail,"
declared Roger. "As it is, I must confess I'm not
much of a trail-finder."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't give up so soon," returned Dave.
"Remember we have the whole day before us."</p>

<p>Presently Ben and Luke, who had turned southward
on the cliff, let out a shout.</p>

<p>"Here is something of a trail," announced Ben,
when the others came hurrying in that direction,
and he pointed to footprints which led through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>some soft soil between a number of low bushes. A
little further on they could see where somebody's
shoes or boots had carried some of the mud up on
to the rocks beyond.</p>

<p>"That certainly does look like a trail," declared
Dave. "Let us follow it up a bit, and see where
it leads to."</p>

<p>This was considered good advice, and soon, led
by our hero, the whole party was moving through
the brushwood and over the rocks. Then they
came once again to the woods, and here discovered
a well-defined trail running southwestward.</p>

<p>"This may be an animal trail for all we know,"
remarked Shadow. "For my part, I can't tell
one kind of trail from another."</p>

<p>"It's quite likely that a fellow like that wild man
would use any trail he came across, and so would
anybody else trying to move around in a wilderness
like this," answered Dave. "I don't think it will
do any harm to follow it for some distance."</p>

<p>"Better keep your eyes open, Dave," cautioned
Phil. "It may lead us into danger."</p>

<p>"I've got my eyes wide open, and I've got the
rifle handy, too," answered our hero, as he once
more led the march forward.</p>

<p>The trail was very narrow in places, so that they
had to walk in single file. It made a long curve
through the forest, and then came out in a little
clearing, backed up by a series of jagged rocks.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>Here there was a small stream, and behind it a
spring of pure, cold water.</p>

<p>"It looks to me as if the animals used this trail
when they wanted a drink," was Luke's comment.
"That water looks pretty good to me," and bending
down, he took a deep draught. "It's fine,"
he went on; "try it!"</p>

<p>The others did as requested, and agreed with
Luke that the water was as good as any they had
ever tasted. Then began more searching, and before
long they found another trail, this time veering
to the westward.</p>

<p>The boys pushed forward once again, Dave still
in the lead; and thus a half mile more was covered.
Then they found themselves between a number of
rocks where, presently, the trail seemed to lose itself.</p>

<p>"Say, Dave, we don't seem to be getting anywhere,"
announced Phil, as having climbed over
several very rough rocks, he stopped to regain his
breath.</p>

<p>"That's right!" broke in Luke. "And say,
we had better go slow unless somebody wants to
sprain an ankle. This is the roughest ground I
ever tried to get over."</p>

<p>"It is easier walking just ahead," announced
Dave, who now stood on the top of one of the
rocks, gazing forward. "Come on! I think I
see the trail too," and he made a leap from one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>rock to another and was soon some distance in advance.</p>

<p>The rough rocks left behind, the boys came out
on a trail which seemed to come from the north
and lead directly up a steep hillside well covered
with tall trees. Here the shade was very thick,
and the slight breeze that was stirring made the
atmosphere decidedly cool.</p>

<p>"Wonder what time it is?" remarked Luke,
and drew out his watch as he spoke. "Well, I
never! Only ten o'clock! I thought it must be
about noon!"</p>

<p>"Getting hungry already?" laughed Dave.
"If you are, we might stop for a bite."</p>

<p>"That's it! let's have a bite to eat, and rest at
the same time," cried Phil. "We brought plenty
of lunch along&mdash;enough for several meals."</p>

<p>The boys sat in a sort of circle on some rocks
and a fallen tree, and while thus resting partook
of a light lunch from one of the knapsacks. Then
they moved forward, up the hillside, and presently
found themselves on the top of the rise.</p>

<p>"Here is quite a view!" announced Shadow,
and they spent a little time in taking in the panorama
spread before them. On one side they
could see Mirror Lake, and on the other the
nearby mountains and also a faraway wagon-road,
which they rightly guessed was that running to Carpen
Falls and the villages beyond.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>"See anything worth looking at outside of the
scenery?" questioned Roger of our hero.</p>

<p>"I see some smoke down in yonder hollow," announced
Dave. "That must come either from
some campfire or else from some cabin, and
whether it is from a campfire or a cabin it means
that some human being must be there."</p>

<p>"Right you are, Dave! And that human being
may be that wild man, or Link Merwell," answered
Ben, quickly.</p>

<p>"How far do you think it is to that smoke?"
asked Phil.</p>

<p>Various guesses were made, and the consensus
of opinion was that the smoke was not over half a
mile distant.</p>

<p>"Let us take the trail leading off in that direction,"
said Dave, and a few minutes later the boys
struck out once more.</p>

<p>Much to their surprise, getting down into the
hollow between the hills and the nearby mountain
was by no means as easy as they had anticipated.
The way proved exceedingly rough, and more than
once one or another of them was in danger of a
serious tumble. As it was, Shadow slipped on the
rocks and scraped his hands in several places.
Then Luke gave a grunt, announcing that he had
barked his left shin.</p>

<p>Dave was still in advance, and now he made a
leap from a rock into some low brushwood. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>he did this there came a sudden cry and a snarl,
followed by the movement of some body through
the brushwood a short distance ahead.</p>

<p>"Hello! what was that?" cried Phil, who was
nearest to our hero.</p>

<p>"I didn't get a very good view of it, Phil," answered
Dave, who now had his rifle ready for
use, "but unless I was much mistaken, it was a
wildcat."</p>

<p>"A wildcat! Great C&aelig;sar! We don't want
to run into any such beast as that, Dave."</p>

<p>"Did you see a wildcat? Where is it?" demanded
Roger, quickly, as he, too, reached Dave's
side.</p>

<p>"It went off in that direction," answered Dave,
pointing with the barrel of his rifle. "See!
There it is!"</p>

<p>As Dave uttered the last words, Roger and Phil
saw a small, tawny-colored body creep out of some
distant bushes and make a leap onto a flat rock.
The beast was indeed a wildcat, and as it came
from cover it swung around for a brief instant to
gaze savagely at the boys. Then it crouched low,
preparatory to making a leap to another rock
higher up.</p>

<p>Crack! It was Dave's rifle that rang out. And
following the report the wildcat was seen to leap
into the air and then fall back on the rock, where it
whirled over and over several times.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>"You hit it, Dave!" yelled Phil and Roger,
simultaneously.</p>

<p>"What did you shoot at?" called out Ben, as
he came plunging forward, followed by Luke and
Shadow.</p>

<p>"A wildcat! See, there it is on the rocks!"
cried Roger.</p>

<p>"A wildcat! I didn't know there were any left
around here," returned Ben, and then he added,
quickly: "There it goes! You didn't kill it
after all, Dave."</p>

<p>As Ben spoke, the wildcat gave another whirl on
the rock, and then slipped off through the bushes
out of sight of the boys.</p>

<p>"I'll give him a shot from my gun if he needs
it," announced Roger, as he hurried forward.</p>

<p>"Be careful that he doesn't get at you first!"
cried Dave, warningly. "If he's only slightly
wounded he'll be a dangerous customer to tackle."</p>

<p>The other boys followed Roger, and, having reloaded
his weapon, Dave followed suit. Soon all
were standing close to the flat rock where the wildcat
had been hit.</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"I don't see him anywhere."</p>

<p>"Be careful, he may land on you before you
know it!"</p>

<p>"There! There! Look yonder!" The last
cry came from Luke, and at his words all turned
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>quickly, to see the wildcat crouch between two
trees growing close to the rocks. With a snarl,
the beast leaped out toward them, the blood flowing
from a wound along one forequarter.</p>

<p>Roger had the shotgun ready, and without taking
time to bring the weapon to his shoulder, he
pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>Bang! went the piece, and then, with a final leap,
the wildcat sprang toward the boys, only to drop
dead at their feet.</p>

<p>"Good! That's the way to do it!" cried Phil,
enthusiastically. "That wildcat won't bother us
any more."</p>

<p>"Dave hit him in the forequarter," announced
Roger, after an examination of the dead animal.
"More than likely the beast would have died from
that wound."</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," returned our hero;
modestly. "You are the one who settled him.
That was a fine shot, Roger. It couldn't have
been better." And on this the others agreed.</p>

<p>As no one cared to take the trouble to skin the
wildcat, the beast was left where it had fallen, and
the boys once more took their way along the trail
leading to the spot where they had seen the smoke.
Soon the trail made another turn, and then came
out on a path which was wider and showed considerable
usage.</p>

<p>"Here are footprints," said Ben, pointing to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>them. "I believe we are getting close to some
sort of a house or cabin."</p>

<p>A few minutes later the broad path they had discovered
made another turn, and then in the distance
they saw a neat log cabin, located on the bank
of a small mountain torrent. From the chimney
of the cabin a thin wreath of smoke was curling.</p>

<p>"That's the smoke we must have seen," announced
Dave. "Now the question is: Who
lives there?"</p>

<p>"And how will they take our arrival," added
Phil.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute!" ordered Dave, and put out
his hand to stop his chums from advancing. He
had seen a man come limping from the mountain
torrent with a bucket of water in his hand. Now
the man stopped in front of the door to the cabin
as if to look around before entering.</p>

<p>"Well, that isn't the wild man; that's sure!
And it isn't Link Merwell, either," announced
Roger.</p>

<p>"Say, I've seen that man before!" cried Phil,
in sudden excitement.</p>

<p>"You have, Phil?" questioned Dave. "Who
is he?"</p>

<p>"Who is he? Unless I am greatly mistaken,
that is my missing uncle, Lester Lawrence!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h2>THE MAN AT THE CABIN</h2>
<br />

<p>"That man is your uncle?"</p>

<p>"Do you mean the man who disappeared so
mysteriously after that robbery?"</p>

<p>"That's the man." Phil's manner showed increased
excitement. "Isn't this the strangest
thing that ever happened? To think of my running
across my uncle in this out-of-the-way place!"</p>

<p>"You want to make sure that he is your uncle
first," warned Dave. "Perhaps he is only somebody
who looks like your relative, the same as that
Ward Porton resembles me," added our hero, with
a grim smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sure that man is my uncle," declared
the shipowner's son.</p>

<p>"Do you think he is the same fellow we saw before&mdash;the
wild man?" queried Roger.</p>

<p>"I don't know as to that. Maybe he is," and
Phil's face now showed worriment. "I do hope
my uncle hasn't lost his mind!"</p>

<p>"Well, he might do that because of his
troubles," was Shadow's comment. "It was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>trouble that affected Wilbur Poole, if you'll remember."</p>

<p>During the course of this conversation, the boys
had withdrawn to the shelter of some trees and
brushwood. In the meantime the man with the
bucket of water had disappeared within the cabin.</p>

<p>"I noticed he limped considerably," remarked
Dave.</p>

<p>"Yes, and he had his left foot bound up," announced
Luke. "More than likely he hurt it in
some way."</p>

<p>"It would be an easy matter for somebody to
hurt his foot if he cut up like that fellow who
nearly scared the girls and Link Merwell to
death," remarked Ben.</p>

<p>"I am going to the cabin and see what he has to
say for himself," declared Phil, resolutely starting
forward.</p>

<p>"If you go we had better go with you," announced
Dave. "But be careful, Phil. If that
man is out of his head he may be dangerous."</p>

<p>"I don't think my Uncle Lester would hurt me
even if he was out of his mind," answered the shipowner's
son, as he moved toward the cabin, followed
closely by the others.</p>

<p>The boys were still a hundred feet or more away
from the habitation when the man reappeared at
the doorway. On catching sight of the newcomers
he uttered a sudden cry of dismay, and then <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>disappeared
like a flash, banging the cabin door shut behind
him.</p>

<p>"Evidently he's not very sociable," remarked
Luke, dryly. "I guess he doesn't want any visitors."</p>

<p>Advancing to the door, Phil knocked loudly.</p>

<p>"Go away from here! I don't want to see any
of you!" cried a heavy voice from within. "Go
away, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Open the door, please. I want to speak with
you," answered Phil, as calmly as he could.</p>

<p>"I won't talk to you! I don't want any one
around this place!" came angrily from within the
cabin. "Go away, or I'll shoot!"</p>

<p>"Say, I don't like this!" cried Shadow, in a low
voice. "I guess we had better get out," and he
started to retreat, followed by Luke and Ben.
Phil, however, stood his ground, and not to desert
their chum, Dave and Roger did the same.</p>

<p>"We are not going to molest you," called out
Phil, after several seconds of silence. "All I
want to do is to talk to you."</p>

<p>"I won't talk to anybody, I tell you! Go
away! If you don't I'll use a shotgun on you!"
returned the man in the cabin.</p>

<p>"Aren't you Mr. Lester Lawrence?" demanded
Phil.</p>

<p>"What's that?" And now the voice of the
man showed sudden interest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>"I say: Aren't you Mr. Lester Lawrence?"
repeated Phil.</p>

<p>"Who said I was Lester Lawrence?" demanded
the man, suspiciously.</p>

<p>"If you are, I must talk to you. I am Phil
Lawrence, your nephew."</p>

<p>"Phil Lawrence!" the boys outside heard the
man mutter to himself. "Phil Lawrence? Oh,
it can't be!" Then he raised his voice: "You
are trying to play some trick on me," he shouted.</p>

<p>"It isn't any trick," put in Dave. "This young
man here is Philip Lawrence, and he is looking for
his uncle, Lester Lawrence. He has good news
for him."</p>

<p>"Good news? I can't believe it! It is some
trick. I want you all to go away."</p>

<p>"Uncle Lester, it isn't any trick. I am Phil,
your nephew. I want to talk to you. I've got the
best kind of news for you; something that you'll be
glad to hear. Won't you please open the door
and let me talk to you?"</p>

<p>"It's a trick, I know it's a trick," came from the
man, in almost a whine. Nevertheless, he advanced
toward the door, and with trembling hands
threw off the bolt that had been shot into place.
Then, with great caution, he opened the door several
inches and peered out.</p>

<p>"Who says he is Philip Lawrence?" he questioned,
sharply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>"I am, Uncle Lester," announced the shipowner's
son. "Don't you remember me? You
used to think the world and all of me some years
ago, when you lived across the street from us."</p>

<p>The man opened the door a little wider, and
gazed sharply into Phil's face. Then his manner
seemed to change, and, allowing the door to swing
wide open, he tottered back and sank down on a
bench.</p>

<p>"It's Phil&mdash;little Phil, sure enough," he murmured.
"How in the world did you come to follow
me to this faraway place?"</p>

<p>"I didn't follow you, Uncle Lester," returned
the youth. "I and my friends were looking for a
wild man who is roaming around in this vicinity,
scaring people, and we reached this place by accident.
We saw you coming to the cabin with a
bucket of water, and I easily recognized you at
once."</p>

<p>"I thought I was safe here&mdash;safe from the
whole world," muttered Lester Lawrence. "But
you said you had good news for me," he added
quickly. "What is it?"</p>

<p>"It's the best kind of news, Uncle Lester.
Don't you know that shortly after you disappeared
the bank authorities and the police found the guilty
parties?"</p>

<p>"They did?" And now the man's face showed
his amazement.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>"Why, sure they did! And then, of course,
they knew that you were innocent."</p>

<p>"Oh, Phil! can this be true?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is true, Uncle Lester, every word
of it! You are an innocent man, and everybody
at home knows it. Father has been trying his
best to get into communication with you. He inserted
personals in the newspapers, and even put
detectives on your track; but, as you know, without
avail."</p>

<p>"Then the world knows that I am innocent!
Thank God for that!" exclaimed the man, with
fervor. "Oh, how I have suffered! And for
such a long time, too!" And tears stood in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"But why didn't you communicate with
father?" asked the nephew. "You ought to
have known that he would be tremendously worried
about you."</p>

<p>"I was bitter, bitter against the whole world.
I didn't think I had a friend left!" cried Lester
Lawrence. "I didn't want to see anybody, and
I didn't want anybody to see me. I was afraid
that they might catch me and put me in jail, and
then if I could not prove my innocence&mdash;and there
was to my mind no way of doing that&mdash;they
would send me to prison for a long term of
years. That's why I made up my mind to disappear."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>"And you've been up here ever since?" asked
Phil.</p>

<p>"No, I've been here only since last Summer.
Before that I was in another section of the Adirondacks."</p>

<p>Lester Lawrence looked at Dave and Roger,
who had followed Phil into the cabin, and at the
other boys, who were crowded around the doorway.</p>

<p>"Who are these; some of your school chums?"
he questioned.</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Lester," answered the shipowner's
son, and introduced his friends one after another.
"They are all good fellows, and I hope you will
consider them as friends."</p>

<p>"I will do that, Phil, if you want me to," was
the reply. "Your revelation has lifted a great
weight from my shoulders. Tell me all the particulars."</p>

<p>Sitting down beside his relative, the shipowner's
son related all that he knew of the occurrences of
the past. Mr. Lawrence listened to the recital
with close attention and asked many questions, his
face meanwhile showing his intense satisfaction.</p>

<p>"What you have told me makes me feel ten
years younger," he declared. "If all this is true&mdash;and
I have no reason to doubt your word&mdash;I
can once more face the world and those who are
dear to me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>"Phil has got another surprise for you, Mr.
Lawrence," put in Dave, when the recital was at
an end. "You will not only be a free man when
you return to your former home, but you will also
have a good deal of money coming to you."</p>

<p>"Indeed! And how is that?"</p>

<p>"It's this way, Uncle Lester," answered Phil,
and thereupon gave a few of the details concerning
the land which the rival railroads wished to purchase
from the uncle and Phil's father.</p>

<p>"That certainly is splendid news!" declared
Lester Lawrence, his eyes lighting up. "What a
wonderful change the last hour has brought! Before
you came I thought I was doomed to live here,
unknown and alone, for perhaps the rest of my
life."</p>

<p>"But how have you managed to live?" asked
Dave, curiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, that has been easy. You see, when I left
home I had quite a little money that belonged to
me. I buy necessary provisions down in one of
the towns, and also do some hunting and fishing.
This cabin belongs to the daughter of an old hunter
who lived here for years, and as she did not wish
to occupy it she let me have it at a very reasonable
rental."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of that wild man who
is in this vicinity?" queried Roger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>At this direct question Lester Lawrence dropped
his eyes and showed much confusion.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I do," he answered, shamefacedly.
"The fact of the matter is, it was I who played
the wild man, dressing myself up in some old outfits
that were left in this cabin by those who used to
live here."</p>

<p>"But what was your purpose?" questioned
Luke.</p>

<p>"I wanted to scare the folks in this vicinity, so
they would not come near this cabin. I was afraid
if too many people came to this neighborhood,
sooner or later somebody might recognize me and
inform the authorities."</p>

<p>"You nearly scared the ladies and girls in our
bungalows to death," said Ben, bluntly.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry for it, now," was the reply.
"But you see, what Phil has told me has put an
entirely different face on the matter. I looked at
all strangers as enemies. I was very bitter against
everybody."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess you had a right to feel bitter,
Uncle Lester," returned Phil, who could realize
how his relative had suffered. "But it's all past
now, and you must give up your life here and come
home with me."</p>

<p>"I am willing to go home, now that I know my
name is cleared," answered Lester Lawrence.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>"But I can't travel just yet," he added, ruefully,
looking down at his bandaged foot.</p>

<p>"What is the trouble?" questioned Dave,
kindly.</p>

<p>"I sprained my ankle the day I followed one of
you boys&mdash;that is, I suppose it was one of your
crowd. I mean the chap who fell over the cliff."</p>

<p>"Link Merwell!" ejaculated Phil. "He is no
friend of ours, he is an enemy. By the way, Uncle
Lester, have you seen him since then?"</p>

<p>"He is an enemy, you say!" cried Mr. Lawrence.
"Is that so? Yes, I saw him. He was
here early this morning, and I chased him away."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h2>TWO DEER</h2>
<br />

<p>"He was here, and you chased him away!"
exclaimed Dave. "Have you any idea where he
went to?"</p>

<p>"I think he took the trail back of the house; the
one leading to Carpen Falls," answered Lester
Lawrence. "I slipped on my most outlandish
costume, and I must have scared him out of his
wits, for he ran like a deer," he added, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"In that case there is no use in our looking for
him around here," announced Roger.</p>

<p>"I think I'll give the hunt up," said Phil.
"Finding my uncle has changed matters completely.
What I want to do is to send word to my
father that my uncle is found. Then, as soon as
he is able to travel, I'll leave you fellows and take
him home."</p>

<p>"I think I'll be able to walk on the foot in a
day or two," answered Lester Lawrence. "You
see I can already hobble around. But that sprain
was a pretty bad one, I can assure you!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>After this the situation was discussed for some
time&mdash;in fact, until well after the noon hour.
Then one of the boys suggested that they have
dinner, and while Phil and his uncle continued to
talk over their personal affairs, Dave and his
chums set about getting ready the meal.</p>

<p>While all in the cabin partook of the midday
meal, the boys told the hermit about their life in
camp, and also of their adventures at Oak Hall
and in other places. Lester Lawrence listened interestedly
to the recital, and asked innumerable
questions concerning their doings, and also questioned
Phil regarding conditions at home.</p>

<p>"I'll leave the matter of that land deal entirely
to your father," he said to his nephew. "He always
had a better head for business than I've got.
He'll know the right thing to do."</p>

<p>After the meal it was decided that Phil should
remain at the cabin with his uncle, while the other
boys returned to Bear Camp. Phil wrote out a
message which he asked Dave and the others to
send to Carpen Falls, from which point it might be
transmitted by telephone and telegraph to his parents,
announcing the finding of the long-lost uncle.</p>

<p>"Now that I have found Uncle Lester, I don't
want to leave him," said Phil to Dave and Roger,
as he drew his two particular chums to one side, out
of hearing of the others. "Uncle Lester may be
all right in his mind&mdash;in fact I hope he is&mdash;but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>at the same time, he has acted so queerly that I
don't want to give him any chance to get away
from me. Besides, I think he ought to rest so that
his lame ankle can get well. I'll do all the work
around here and stay until some of you get back,
which I suppose will be in a day or two."</p>

<p>"All right, Phil. You stay with him, by all
means," answered our hero. "We'll attend to
this message, and we'll wait to see if any message
comes back from your father."</p>

<p>The boys to return to Bear Camp had thought
they must go by the way they had come, but Lester
Lawrence told them to follow the mountain torrent
for a distance of a quarter of a mile, and then
they would reach a broad and well-defined trail
leading to the brook which flowed into Mirror
Lake.</p>

<p>"It's a much shorter route," he said, "and you
will find the traveling much easier."</p>

<p>It was about half an hour later when Dave and
the others bid Phil and Mr. Lawrence good-bye,
and set out on the return to Bear Camp. Our
hero still had possession of the rifle, and Roger
carried the shotgun. Under the heavy trees it
was both dark and cold, and the boys hurried
along as rapidly as possible, not only to make time,
but also to keep warm. Dave and Roger were in
advance, discussing the finding of Phil's uncle.</p>

<p>"I'm mighty glad on Phil's account that his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>uncle has been found," remarked Dave. "The
selling of that land at a handsome profit will be a
big lift for the Lawrence family."</p>

<p>"Yes. And how it will please Phil's parents
to have Mr. Lawrence's brother back!" responded
Roger. "As it was, they did not know
whether he was dead or alive. It's a terrible
thing to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roger broke off short, for at that instant Dave
clapped his hand over his chum's mouth and drew
him quickly behind a nearby tree. They were
well in advance of their friends, and now our hero
motioned the others to keep back.</p>

<p>"What is it? What is the trouble?" called
out Ben.</p>

<p>"It's a deer, keep quiet!" answered Dave, in
a low tone.</p>

<p>"A deer! Where?" questioned Roger.</p>

<p>"Over yonder, by the white birch."</p>

<p>The senator's son looked in the direction indicated,
but for the moment saw nothing out of the
ordinary. Then, however, a head appeared from
between some bushes back of the white birch, and
presently a beautiful deer stalked into view.</p>

<p>"I see him," whispered Roger, excitedly.
"There is your chance, Dave, plug him!"</p>

<p>Our hero already had the rifle raised. He was
about to pull the trigger when he paused, for he
had seen the bushes back of the deer move.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>"What's up? Why don't you shoot?" whispered
Roger, his voice betraying excitement.</p>

<p>"I think there's another deer there, Roger,"
whispered our hero, in return. "Yes, there he
is! Now then, you will have a shot yourself.
Take the one on the left and I'll take the one on
the right."</p>

<p>"All right," returned the senator's son, and
raised the double-barreled shotgun. "Are you
ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When I say 'three,' fire," answered
Dave, quickly. "One, two, three!"</p>

<p>Crack! Bang! The two pieces rang out in
quick succession, and as the reports echoed
through the forest both deer gave a wild leap into
the air. Then the animal at which Dave had shot
plunged forward on its knees and fell into some
brushwood, kicking wildly. The other deer
whirled around and started to run for cover.</p>

<p>"Give it the other barrel, Roger!" yelled
Dave, as he ran forward.</p>

<p>There was no need of this advice, for while
Dave was yet speaking the second barrel of the
shotgun was discharged at the flying deer.
Roger's aim this time proved to be better than
before, and plunging forward, the deer ran full
tilt into a tree and then pitched over on its side,
where it soon breathed its last.</p>

<p>Long before Dave reached his quarry he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>ready for a second shot should the game require
it. But when he reached the deer's side he found
that the end of the animal was close at hand.
Then he rejoined his chum, who was watching the
other deer.</p>

<p>"Is he dead, Roger?" he asked, quickly.</p>

<p>"I think he is, Dave," was the answer, and
Roger's tone showed his exaltation. "My! but
this is luck; isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I should say yes! Two deer at a clip!"</p>

<p>"How about the one you hit; is it dead?"</p>

<p>"Just about," was Dave's reply, and then he
hurried over to the game, to note that it was
breathing its last.</p>

<p>"How did you make out?" The cry came
from Ben, as he came running forward, followed
by Luke and Shadow.</p>

<p>"Did you hit anything?" queried the former
story-teller of Oak Hall.</p>

<p>"Did they hit anything!" yelled Luke. "Say,
this is great, they got two of them!"</p>

<p>"This is what I call wholesale hunting!" announced
Ben.</p>

<p>"You fellows certainly opened the hunting
season in great shape," was Shadow's comment.
"A wildcat and two deer all in one day!"</p>

<p>The boys dragged the two deer together, and
it must be confessed that Dave and Roger looked
at their quarry with great pride.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>"How are we going to get those down to the
bungalows?" asked the senator's son.</p>

<p>"I think the best thing to do will be to tie their
feet together and slip each of them on a long
pole," returned Dave.</p>

<p>A small hatchet had been brought along for
possible use in cutting firewood, and with this the
boys cut down two long and slender saplings.
Then they tied up the deer as our hero had mentioned,
and a sapling was thrust between the front
and hind legs of each of the game, allowing the
body to hang below.</p>

<p>"Here, Ben, you can carry the rifle," announced
Dave. "I'll take one end of one load."</p>

<p>"And I'll help carry with you," announced
Luke.</p>

<p>"I'll carry my share of the load," offered
Roger, and he picked up one end of the second
sapling, while Shadow took the other. Thus carrying
the loads between them, and with Ben going
ahead with the rifle, they continued on the return
to Bear Camp.</p>

<p>Progress with such heavy loads was necessarily
slow, and several times the boys stopped to rest.
It was well toward nightfall when they reached
the stream flowing into Mirror Lake.</p>

<p>Having gained the watercourse, it was an easy
matter for them to continue onward until they
reached the vicinity of the two bungalows. As
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>soon as they came in sight of the camp, several
set up a shout, which quickly brought Laura and
Belle into view.</p>

<p>"Home again, and with lots of good news!"
cried Dave, swinging his cap.</p>

<p>"Oh, look, they have two deer!" exclaimed
the girl from the West. "Isn't that grand?"</p>

<p>"It certainly is," returned Laura; but her voice
had little of enthusiasm in it.</p>

<p>"Where is Uncle Dunston?" cried Dave. "I
want him to look at what Roger and I shot."</p>

<p>"Your uncle has gone home," answered Belle.
At the same time Laura turned away.</p>

<p>"Gone home!" repeated Dave, in bewilderment.
"Why, what made him do that? I didn't
know he was going until next week."</p>

<p>"He went with Mr. Wadsworth," continued
Belle. "They had some very important business
to attend to."</p>

<p>"What was it? Laura, do you know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, Dave," answered the girl, and
now her voice had a curious, uncertain ring in it.
"Oh, Dave, it's the most awful thing I ever heard
of! I don't see how I am ever going to tell
you!" she burst out; and then, of a sudden, began
to cry and ran into the bungalow.</p>
<br />
<br />

<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>

<h2>STARTLING NEWS</h2>
<br />

<p>Dave was so surprised that for the moment he
knew not what to say or do. His eyes followed
Laura as she disappeared within the bungalow,
and then he turned in bewilderment to Belle.</p>

<p>"Laura takes it awfully hard, but I don't think
she ought to&mdash;at least not yet," said the girl from
Star Ranch. "There may not be a word of truth
in the story. Anyway, I'm not going to believe
it until they prove it."</p>

<p>"But what are you talking about, Belle?"
questioned Dave, his face still showing his perplexity.
"What is it all about? Has anything
happened at home? It isn't my father; is it?"</p>

<p>"No, there is nothing wrong at your home,
Dave&mdash;at least not in the way you think." Belle
paused for a moment as if not knowing how to go
on. "You remember what Link Merwell said;
don't you?"</p>

<p>"About me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course I don't believe it at all.
But this young fellow, Ward Porton, sent word
to your father, and that has upset him a great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>deal, so that he sent word to your Uncle Dunston
and Laura, as well as to Mr. Wadsworth. The
word came in this morning, a couple of hours after
you had left; and after talking the matter over,
your uncle and Mr. Wadsworth made up their
minds to return to Crumville without delay."</p>

<p>"And what did this Ward Porton have to
say?" questioned our hero, and it was with an
effort that he steadied his voice.</p>

<p>"I can't give you all the particulars, because
Laura did not show me the letter. Poor dear!
it just broke her up completely, and I've had an
awful time with her&mdash;and I've had an awful time
with Jessie, too."</p>

<p>"But you must know something," went on
Dave, while the others gathered around, their
faces showing their intense curiosity.</p>

<p>"Well, as near as I can make out, this Ward
Porton has been investigating matters connected
with himself and with you, and he claims that he
is the real Dave Porter and that you are somebody
else."</p>

<p>"Oh, say, that's nonsense!" burst out Phil,
quickly. "Why, we proved Dave's identity beyond
question, when we came back from our trip
to the South Seas."</p>

<p>"Sure we did!" added Roger. "Dave's
uncle went into all of the details with the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>Crumville
poorhouse authorities, and also got the particulars
of how that fellow named Sandy Margot,
the good-for-nothing husband of that crazy nurse,
Polly Margot, abducted Dave and took him on
a railroad train, and then got scared and put him
off at Crumville."</p>

<p>"I am sure I hope what you say is true,
Roger," responded the girl from the West.
"What this Porton bases his claim on I don't
know. As I said before, I didn't read the letter
Dave's uncle turned over to Laura."</p>

<p>"I must go in and find out about this," said
Dave, in a curiously unnatural voice. His mind
was in a whirl, and for the time being his good
luck at hunting, and the finding of Phil's uncle and
the clearing up of the mystery of the wild man,
were completely forgotten.</p>

<p>He found Laura in one of the bedrooms of the
bungalow, sitting in a chair by the window, with
her hands clasped tightly together and her face
firm-set and drawn. As she looked up at him,
two fresh tears stood out on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"They tell me that Uncle Dunston got a letter
about me," said the youth, doing his best to steady
his voice. "Will you let me see it?"</p>

<p>"It's on the table," returned the girl, motioning
with her hand. And then she added impetuously:
"Oh, Dave, I can't believe it's true, I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>simply can't! Why, it's the most dreadful thing
that ever came up! I am sure there must be some
mistake!"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't understand it," Dave stammered
in return, and then picked up the communication
which had been sent by special messenger from
Carpen Falls. The letter ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Dunston</span>:</p>

<p>"A most astonishing thing has come up, and
I wish you would return to Crumville at once;
and it might be well to bring Mr. Wadsworth
with you.</p>

<p>"I cannot go into all the details because I am
completely upset. Briefly stated the matter is
this: A young man named Ward Porton&mdash;the
same fellow who was in Crumville some time ago
with Link Merwell&mdash;has written to me, stating
that he has every reason to believe that he is the
real Dave Porter, and that our Dave is somebody
else. His story is that he was left in a poorhouse
at Lumberville, Maine, by an old woman who obtained
him from Sandy Margot, who told her the
child had been under the care of Polly, his wife.
The claim is also made that Sandy Margot had in
reality stolen two children, little boys, at about
the same time, and the theory is advanced that
the other boy was the one dropped from the train
at Crumville. The young man states that he has
gone into the matter very carefully, and has a
number of proofs which he will submit whenever
called on to do so. He adds that he feels sorry
for Dave, but hopes that I will find in him as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>good a son, and also hopes that Laura will like
him as well as a brother.</p>

<p>"I am so upset that I hardly know what to
think or what to do. If this young man's story
is true, then all of us have made a sad mistake,
and what Dave is to do in the matter I don't know.
Come on as soon as possible and help me to get
to the bottom of this terrible mix-up.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="padding-right: 8em;">"Your affectionate brother,</span><br />
<span style="padding-right: 6em;" class="smcap">David Breslow Porter."</span></p></div>

<p>Dave read this letter with care, and then allowed
the communication to slip from his fingers.
If his mind had been in a whirl before, it was
more so now, and for the moment he could hardly
think straight. If he was not Dave Porter, who
was he? A thousand ideas ran riot through his
brain.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave! it can't be true; can it?" came
half-pleadingly from Laura.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he answered dumbly. "I
don't know."</p>

<p>"But, Dave, I thought that you and Uncle
Dunston proved your identity completely, even
before you found father and met me."</p>

<p>"I always supposed we did prove it, Laura,"
he answered. "We went into the matter very
carefully at that time. Nothing was ever said
about Sandy Margot stealing two little boys. I
always supposed he had taken only one child."</p>

<p>"And to think this other young man is a perfect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>stranger," went on Laura, dolefully. "There is
no telling what sort of a person he is."</p>

<p>"He's no stranger to me. I helped to pull him
out of the water when the steam yacht was on
fire," answered Dave. "I guess he's all right as
far as that goes, although I don't think much of
his keeping company with Link Merwell."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose it can be a plot hatched up
by Link Merwell?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think. This news stuns
me. I've got to consider it. Maybe I had better
go back to Crumville, too."</p>

<p>"No, Uncle Dunston said you had better stay
here&mdash;at least for the present. He said if they
wanted you they could send you word."</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," and now Dave's voice showed
a faint trace of bitterness. "Maybe they don't
want me around, if they have really settled it that
I am not the real Dave Porter."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave! Don't want you around!"
Laura sprang to her feet, and coming over to him,
caught both his hands in her own. "Don't talk
that way. Even if they should prove that you are
not my brother, I shall always think just as much
of you."</p>

<p>"Thank you for saying that, Laura," he returned,
with much emotion. "It's nice to know
that there is somebody who won't go back on
me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>"I don't believe anybody will go back on you,
Dave&mdash;you have always been so good. Oh, I
think this is dreadful&mdash;just dreadful!" and
Laura showed signs of bursting into tears once
more.</p>

<p>"Where are Jessie and Mrs. Wadsworth, and
Mrs. Basswood?"</p>

<p>"I think Jessie went over to the other bungalow
with her mother. She was as much upset as
I was."</p>

<p>"Does she think the story is true?"</p>

<p>"She hopes it isn't. But of course she can't
do anything&mdash;and I can't do anything either."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't see what I can do." Dave took
a turn up and down the room, and then sank on a
chair. "This just knocks me endwise. I can't
even seem to think straight," he added, helplessly.</p>

<p>"You poor boy!" Laura came over and
brushed back the hair from his forehead. "You
don't know how this hurts, Dave. Oh, it can't
be true!"</p>

<p>"I wonder how long I've got to wait before I
hear from Crumville?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know. I think, though,
we'll get word just as soon as they know anything
definite."</p>

<p>At that moment came a timid knock on the
door, and Laura opened it to admit Jessie. The
appearance of the girl showed that she was much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>upset. Her face was tear-stained and her hair
awry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave!" was all she said. And then
coming straight toward him, she threw her head
on his shoulder and burst into a fit of weeping.</p>

<p>"There, there, Jessie! Don't you cry so," he
said, soothingly. "I am sure it will be all right."</p>

<p>"But Da-Dave, hasn't Laura to-told you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she has told me."</p>

<p>"And did you read that letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But it can't be true, Dave! Oh, tell me it
can't be true!" went on the girl, pleadingly.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you whether it is true or not, Jessie,
for I don't know," answered the boy, as
bravely as he could. "I suppose they'll investigate
the matter at Crumville and at that place in
Maine, and let me know." He looked at her
curiously. "What if they prove I am not the
real Dave Porter, Jessie&mdash;will you care very
much?"</p>

<p>"Care? Of course I'll care, Dave! But
don't misunderstand me," she added, quickly.
"Even if they prove you are not the real Dave
Porter, it won't make any difference to me. I
shall think just as much of you, no matter who you
are."</p>

<p>"Do you really mean that?" and he clutched
her tightly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>"I certainly do! What difference will it really
make? You will be yourself, no matter what
your name is."</p>

<p>"I know, Jessie, I'll be myself; but who will I
be? Perhaps I'll be a 'poorhouse nobody' after
all," and he smiled bitterly.</p>

<p>"Never!" returned the girl, emphatically.
"You'll never be a nobody, Dave. You are too
true, both to yourself and to those around you.
You'll make a name for yourself in this world even
if they take your present name away from you;"
and as she spoke the girl's words rang with
earnestness.</p>

<p>A great and peculiar joy seemed to creep over
Dave, and despite the blackness of the situation,
his heart for the moment felt light. He gazed
with emotion at both Laura and Jessie.</p>

<p>"If that's the way you feel about it&mdash;and
Laura says she feels the same&mdash;I'm not going to
worry just yet," he answered.</p>
<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h2>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<br />

<p>That evening the sole topic of conversation at
Bear Camp was the news concerning Dave. The
other lads could not bear to question Laura or
Jessie on the subject, knowing how badly both of
them must feel; but they asked Belle to tell all she
knew, and also quizzed Mrs. Wadsworth and
Mrs. Basswood.</p>

<p>"It's the worst state of affairs I have ever
known," was the way the jewelry manufacturer's
wife expressed herself, in private to Roger and
Phil. "We, as you know, think the world and
all of Dave, and we don't want him to drop back
and become a nobody, even in name. He is a
splendid boy, and no matter what happens we shall
always think as much of him as we ever did."</p>

<p>"I think all his friends will stick to him," answered
Roger. "At the same time, this will cut
him to the heart; and what he'll do if they really
prove he isn't Dave Porter, I don't know."</p>

<p>"Maybe the Porters will continue to keep him
in the family as an adopted son," suggested Phil.
"That is, if this report really proves to be true,
which I don't believe will happen."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>"I have always thought a great deal of Dave,
ever since he saved Jessie from that gasoline explosion,"
returned Mrs. Wadsworth. "Should
they find out that he is not a Porter, I think I
would be strongly in favor of my husband adopting
him."</p>

<p>"Say, that wouldn't be half bad!" burst out
Phil, "and the suggestion does you credit, Mrs.
Wadsworth. Personally, I think Dave is the
finest fellow in the world."</p>

<p>"I am sure we all think that," added Roger.
"Since he went to Oak Hall he has made a host
of real friends, and I don't think one of them will
desert him."</p>

<p>While this conversation was going on, the other
boys were talking to our hero, doing their best to
cheer him up and to convince him that, no matter
what happened, they would stick to him.</p>

<p>"You take it from me," declared Luke, "this is
some scheme gotten up by Link Merwell and this
other fellow!"</p>

<p>"Certainly it's a scheme!" added Shadow.
"It puts me in mind of a story I once heard about
a fellow down South who stole three watermelons,
and&mdash;&mdash;But, oh, pshaw! what's the use of trying
to tell a story now? I'm going to cut them
out until we get this thing settled," he added, in
disgust.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, Dave. I am sure it will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>come out all right in the end," was what Ben said,
speaking with an apparent conviction that he did
not by any means feel.</p>

<p>"You're all kind, fellows, and I appreciate it
very much," answered Dave. "But this is a blow
to me. If you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a little
walk by myself and think it over." And thus
speaking, the youth withdrew from the crowd, and
walked slowly to the lake and along a footpath
bordering the shore.</p>

<p>"It's the rankest shame I ever knew!" declared
Ben, when the others were left to themselves.
"If I had that Ward Porton here I'd wring his
neck."</p>

<p>"I guess we'd all like to do that," responded
Shadow. "Nevertheless, if he is the real Dave
Porter you can't blame him for trying to prove it."</p>

<p>"There is only one thing about it that troubles
me," said Luke. "Don't you remember that all
of those who saw this Ward Porton agreed that
he looked very much like Mr. Dunston Porter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but Dave looks like Dunston Porter,
too," came quickly from Ben.</p>

<p>"It's queer that he resembles his uncle more
than he does his father," was Shadow's comment.
"Maybe this Ward Porton resembles Mr. David
Porter."</p>

<p>"Well, it's fierce; that's all I've got to say,"
declared Ben. "And what Dave is going to do
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>if they prove he isn't the real Dave Porter is something
I don't like to think about. In those days
when we first went to Oak Hall, you'll remember
how bitter he felt when some of his enemies referred
to him as that 'poorhouse nobody,' and
how eager he was to clear up the mystery of his
identity, even though it cost him a trip to the
South Sea Islands."</p>

<p>Dave walked on and on along the lake shore,
paying little attention to where he was going.
His mind was in a state bordering on bewilderment.
In a faint, uncertain way he had anticipated
some such calamity, but now that the blow
had fallen, the matter looked almost hopeless to
him. Had he followed his own inclinations, he
would have made preparations to return to Crumville
at once.</p>

<p>"But evidently they don't want me there," he
told himself, bitterly. "They want to solve this
mystery without my interference. And if they do
make up their minds that I am not the real Dave
Porter, I wonder how they will treat me? Of
course, they may be very kind to me&mdash;the same
as Laura and Jessie and the others up here. But
kindness of that sort isn't everything. I don't
want any one to support me if I haven't some
claim on him." And then Dave shut his teeth
hard, clenched his hands, and walked on faster
than ever.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>Finally tired out because he had been on his feet
since early morning, Dave sat down on a flat rock
to rest. As he did this, he heard the put-put of
a motor, and presently around a bend of the shore
showed the headlight of Mr. Appleby's motor-boat.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they are simply going down to the
end of the lake, or whether they are going to stop
at our place," said Dave, to himself. "I'd rather
they wouldn't stop at Bear Camp to-night, when
everything is so upset."</p>

<p>As the motor-boat swung around, the headlight
flashed full upon our hero and there followed an
exclamation from the manager of the moving-picture
company, who was at the wheel of the
craft, with two men beside him.</p>

<p>"Hello there, Porter! What are you doing&mdash;fishing?"</p>

<p>"No, I just came down here to sit on the rock
and do a little thinking," answered Dave.</p>

<p>"We are making a little trip around the lake,"
went on Mr. Appleby. "I was going to stop at
your dock and deliver a letter that came in our
mail by mistake. It's a letter for you, so I might
as well give it to you now."</p>

<p>"A letter for me, eh?" answered Dave.</p>

<p>"Yes, here you are!" went on Mr. Appleby,
as the motor-boat came to a standstill close by.
"I'll put it in the newspaper and you can have that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>too, as we have read it;" and suiting the action
to the word, the man placed the letter in the folds
of the paper and tossed the latter ashore.</p>

<p>"Will you stop?" questioned Dave.</p>

<p>"Not to-night. We are going to make a call
on the other side of the lake. I just thought I'd
give you the letter, that's all," and then, with a
pleasant good-bye, the manager steered his motor-boat
out into Mirror Lake again.</p>

<p>It was too dark to read the letter without a
light, and as Dave did not happen to have even a
match, he walked back to the bungalows. The
lanterns were hung out on the porches as was the
custom, and under the light of one of these he
looked at the communication he had received.</p>

<p>"It's from Crumville!" he exclaimed to himself,
eagerly, as he looked at the postmark. But
then, as he recognized the handwriting, his face
fell. "It's only from Nat Poole."</p>

<p>The communication from the money-lender's
son was a long one, containing much news which
it will be unnecessary to give here. There was,
however, one paragraph in the letter which Dave
read with great interest.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am sorry if you put yourselves out trying to
catch that wild man thinking he was my Uncle
Wilbur. As I told you, my uncle got away from
the sanitarium and they had quite a job to locate
him. They found him up in the vicinity of Oak
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>Hall, at one of the houses where he had once
stayed. They got him to return to the sanitarium
without any trouble, and the doctors think that he
is now doing finely."</p></div>

<p>"Hello, Dave! what are you reading?" remarked
Roger, coming up.</p>

<p>"Here's a letter from Nat Poole," and our
hero told how he had received it. "You can read
it for yourself. They have found Wilbur Poole,
and have put him back in the sanitarium."</p>

<p>"Is that so? Well, I am glad they caught
him." And then Roger read the letter, and went
off to spread the news among the other boys.</p>

<p>The next day was a long one for Dave. While
Ben and Luke went to Carpen Falls with a letter
directed to Phil's father, he spent part of the time
dressing the two deer. But his heart was not in
the work, and his friends noted his absent-mindedness.
Several times he looked down in the direction
of the trail leading to Carpen Falls, and they
knew he was hoping for some messenger to appear,
summoning him to come to Crumville.</p>

<p>"It makes me sick to see Dave so downcast,"
whispered Ben to Roger, that evening. "I wish
we could cheer him up."</p>

<p>"I don't see how we are going to do it. We
can't lift that burden from his mind. We have
simply got to wait until some word comes from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>Porters at Crumville. I don't believe they'll keep
Dave waiting any longer than necessary."</p>

<p>"But think of the terrible suspense!"</p>

<p>"I know it. It's too bad!"</p>

<p>The afternoon had been cloudy, and late in the
evening it began to rain. Then the wind came up,
moaning through the forest in melancholy fashion
and sending thousands of whitecaps across the
surface of the lake.</p>

<p>"It isn't Mirror Lake to-night," said Belle,
with a little shiver. "It's more like Foamy
Lake."</p>

<p>"I don't think I'd want to go out in a canoe
to-night," returned Phil, who was beside her.</p>

<p>"I think we are going to have quite a storm,"
said Laura. "Just listen to that wind!"</p>

<p>With fitful gusts tearing around the bungalows,
no one felt much like going to bed. About ten
o'clock came a hard downpour, lasting for half an
hour. Then the wind died away, and gradually
the rain ceased.</p>

<p>"I guess the worst of it is over," announced
Mrs. Wadsworth, presently. "I think we may as
well retire." And shortly after that all of the
inmates of both bungalows were in bed.</p>

<p>For a long while Dave could not sleep. As
had been the case the night previous, he tumbled
and tossed on his couch, thinking of the trouble
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>that had come to him. But at last tired nature
claimed its own, and he sank into a profound
slumber, from which he did not awaken until some
time after sunrise.</p>

<p>"Hello! I must have overslept," he declared,
as he leaped up, to see that his chums were almost
dressed.</p>

<p>Dave was just finishing his toilet, and the other
boys and some of the girls had started to walk
down to the dock to look at the lake, when a cry
came from the kitchen of the bungalow.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wadsworth! Mr. Porter!" came a
call from the hired girl. "Please come here!"</p>

<p>"What is it, Mary?" asked Mrs. Wadsworth,
as she appeared from her own room.</p>

<p>"Sure, ma'am, a whole lot of things are missing!"
declared the girl.</p>

<p>"Missing! What is missing?"</p>

<p>"Sure, ma'am, almost everything in the kitchen
is missing, ma'am!" and the girl pointed around
in a helpless sort of fashion. "All the knives and
forks and spoons are gone! And so are some of
the pots and pans and kettles!"</p>

<p>"Is that possible?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am. And that ain't all, ma'am.
Sure, and most of the things in the pantry and in
the ice-box are gone, too!" announced Mary, running
from one place to another. "Sure, ma'am,
we've been burglarized, ma'am!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h2>DELLA FORD'S STATEMENT</h2>
<br />

<p>"Burglars!"</p>

<p>"Did they take any of our valuables?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I wonder if they were in our rooms!"</p>

<p>"Mary, were all the things here when you went
to bed?" questioned Mrs. Wadsworth, of the
servant girl, who was now in the wildest possible
state of excitement, wringing her hands and running
from one room to another.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, when I went to bed everything
was in its place. I'm sure of it, ma'am."</p>

<p>The boys as well as the girls crowded into the
kitchen, and then looked into the pantry, in a
corner of which was located the ice-box.</p>

<p>"How about this pantry window, Mary? Did
you leave it open last night?" asked Dave, pointing
to the window in question.</p>

<p>"Sure, sir, I did not! I always lock up well
before I go to bed," answered the girl.</p>

<p>"You didn't open the window this morning?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then that is where the thief must have come
in," remarked Roger.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>"I think we had better take a look around and
see just how much is missing," advised Phil.
"The thief may have cleaned us out more than
we imagine."</p>

<p>Upon this, a systematic search was made
through all the rooms of the bungalow. In the
midst of the work Ben came running over from the
other place.</p>

<p>"Say, what do you know about this!" he called
out. "Somebody visited our bungalow last night
and took nearly all our victuals and our tableware
and our kitchen utensils!"</p>

<p>"The same thing happened here, Ben," answered
Dave. "We are just sizing up the situation,
to find out how much is gone."</p>

<p>"The others are at that now over at our bungalow.
I thought I'd run over to tell you. I'll go
back and tell them you are in the same fix. This
is fierce; isn't it?" And then Ben hurried away.</p>

<p>An examination of the premises showed that all
the tableware of value had disappeared, along
with two rings which Laura had left on the mantelpiece
in the living-room. From the kitchen
nearly everything used in cooking was gone, and
likewise almost everything from the pantry and
the ice-box.</p>

<p>"Oh, my two rings!" burst out Laura. "The
diamond that dad gave me and the beautiful ruby
from Uncle Dunston!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>"It's too bad, Laura!" declared Jessie.</p>

<p>"That's what it is!" said Dave. "We'll have
to get after that burglar, whoever he is."</p>

<p>"This looks to me like the work of some of
these people who are camping out in the Adirondacks,"
announced Roger. "What would an ordinary
burglar do with a lot of kitchen utensils, not
to mention canned goods and stuff from an ice-box?"</p>

<p>"Maybe they took the stuff from the ice-box to
eat," suggested Dave. "It might be that they
would rather camp out than run the risk of going
to Carpen Falls, or to some of the hotels, for their
meals."</p>

<p>Having completed the search in the bungalows,
the boys, followed by the others, went outside.
Here they discovered a great number of footprints
leading back and forth from the pantry window to
the edge of the forest. Among some jagged
rocks, the trail was lost.</p>

<p>"Looks to me as if there must have been half a
dozen fellows in this raid," announced Roger.
"What do you think of it, Dave?"</p>

<p>"Either that, or else the fellow who did the
job made a dozen trips or more. To me, the footprints
look very much alike."</p>

<p>Presently the crowd went over to the Basswood
bungalow, and there learned that, among other
things, some solid silver tableware which Mrs.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>Basswood had brought along had vanished.</p>

<p>"I was foolish to bring such expensive silver,"
declared the lady of the house. "But I thought
we could use it if we happened to have visitors. I
never dreamed of being robbed up here."</p>

<p>At the Basswood bungalow an entrance to the
kitchen and pantry had been effected through the
woodshed, the door of which had been broken
open. From this shed a trail led up to the jagged
rocks previously mentioned.</p>

<p>"The same rascal or the same crowd that did
one job did both," declared Dave.</p>

<p>"I don't know what we are going to do for
breakfast," declared Mrs. Wadsworth, rather
helplessly. "We have next to nothing to cook,
and nothing to cook it in."</p>

<p>"We are in the same fix," answered Mrs. Basswood.
"It certainly is a terrible state of affairs. I
wish my husband was here to tell us what to do."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't worry about something to eat!"
cried Dave. "We can go down to Carpen Falls
and get whatever we want, and also get some extra
kitchen utensils, and don't forget the deer-meat.
What worries me is the loss of Laura's rings and
Mrs. Basswood's silverware."</p>

<p>"We might go up into the woods and look
around," suggested Ben, "although it's mighty wet
up there from the rain."</p>

<p>The matter was talked over for a while longer,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>and in the meantime the ladies and the girls, aided
by the hired help, made an inventory of what was
left in the way of eatables.</p>

<p>"We can give all of you some coffee and some
fancy crackers," said Mrs. Wadsworth.</p>

<p>"And we have found two cans of baked beans,"
added Mrs. Basswood. "They'll go some distance
toward filling up the boys," and she smiled
faintly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what we might do!" cried Roger.
"Supposing four of us fellows jump into the four-oared
boat and row up to the Appleby camp? I
am sure they have plenty of provisions, and they'll
lend us some until we can get in a new lot from
Carpen Falls. And maybe they'll lend us a few
cooking utensils, too."</p>

<p>"That's the thing to do!" returned Ben.
"Come on, let's go up there at once;" and so it
was settled.</p>

<p>Dave and Luke accompanied Ben and Roger on
the trip; and as the four youths had often rowed
together on the Leming River at Oak Hall, they
soon covered the distance to the camp of the moving-picture
people. They saw the crowd getting
ready to depart for the enacting of the final drama
in that locality.</p>

<p>"Hello, you're out bright and early in your
boat!" cried Mr. Appleby, as he waved his hand
to them. "Taking a little exercise, eh?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>"No, we came for assistance," called back Ben.</p>

<p>"Assistance!" repeated the manager.
"What's the trouble?"</p>

<p>"We have been burglarized, and we have
hardly anything left to eat!" broke in Luke, and
at this announcement all of those in the Appleby
camp came down to the dock to learn the particulars
of what had occurred.</p>

<p>"In one way you have come at just the right
time to get those things," said the manager of the
moving-picture company to the boys. "We are
going to leave here to-morrow to go back to
Boston, so we shall want but little of the food that
is on hand. And you'll be welcome to use our
tableware and kitchen utensils. They belong here
in the cottage, so all you'll have to do when you
get through with them will be to bring them back."</p>

<p>While rowing to the Appleby camp, Dave had
been giving serious thought to his own affairs.
He remembered what he had heard concerning
Ward Porton and Della Ford, and resolved to
question the young lady and the other members
of the moving-picture company about the young
man who claimed to be the real Dave Porter.
Our hero's chance came when the other boys were
busy placing some provisions and cooking utensils
in the rowboat. He motioned Della Ford and
her aunt to one side, and the three walked out of
hearing of the others present.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>"If you don't mind, I would like to ask you
something about Mr. Ward Porton," said our
hero, to the girl.</p>

<p>"O dear, I thought I was done with that young
man!" cried Della, with a toss of her head.</p>

<p>"He bothered my niece so much while he was
a member of the company she got quite sick of
him," declared Mrs. Ford. "He was a very forward
young man."</p>

<p>"I'd like very much to find out about his past
history: where he came from, and all that," went
on Dave. "It's something very important."</p>

<p>"I know more about Mr. Porton than he thinks
I do," announced Della. "That's one reason
why I dropped him."</p>

<p>"But Della, you don't want to get into any
trouble," interposed the girl's aunt, quickly.</p>

<p>"If you'll tell me what you know about Ward
Porton, I'll promise that it won't get you into any
trouble," answered Dave, quickly. "I want, if
possible, to find out where he came from, and who
brought him up."</p>

<p>"Who brought him up?" queried Mrs. Ford.
"Didn't he live with his parents?"</p>

<p>"He says not. He claims to have come from
a poorhouse in a town down in Maine."</p>

<p>"Why, you don't tell me, Mr. Porter!" exclaimed
the lady, in astonishment. "He told me
once that he had lived with his folks up to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>time he was about ten years old, and that then his
parents had died and he had gone to live with an
uncle."</p>

<p>"Yes, and he did live with an uncle&mdash;or at
least some man he called his uncle," added Della.</p>

<p>"Are you certain of this?" asked our hero,
eagerly.</p>

<p>"I am, Mr. Porter."</p>

<p>"And may I ask what the thing was that you
knew about him that caused you to drop him?"
continued Dave.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, Della, before you answer that
question," interposed Mrs. Ford, hastily. "I
think we ought to know why Mr. Porter is after
this information."</p>

<p>"Since we have gone so far, I may as well tell
you," returned Dave. And in as few words as
possible he related how it had come about that
Ward Porton was now claiming to be the real
Dave Porter.</p>

<p>"Why, what a queer story!" declared Mrs.
Ford. "It sounds like some novel."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it's true, Mr. Porter!" cried
Della Ford. "I believe he is a faker! At first
I thought he was quite nice, but I soon discovered
otherwise. He is addicted to gambling, and when
he gets the fever he gambles away the very clothing
on his back."</p>

<p>"Then that is why you broke with him?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>"That was one reason. But as I said before, I
know more about Mr. Porton than he imagined.
One day we had been out walking, and after he
left me I picked up a letter which must have
dropped from his pocket when he pulled out his
cigarette case. As the letter had no envelope, I
did not know whose it was, and read it. It was
evidently written by a very angry man. The
writer, who signed himself Obadiah Jones, said
that he was sick and tired of putting up for Ward;
that Ward could no longer expect any assistance
from him; that he cast the young man off, and
never wanted to hear from him again."</p>

<p>"And you say that letter was signed by a man
named Obadiah Jones?" asked Dave, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes. Rather an old-fashioned name; isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Did the man give his address?"</p>

<p>"No, there was no address of any kind on the
letter," answered Della Ford.</p>

<p>"Was this Obadiah Jones the man he said was
his uncle?" continued our hero.</p>

<p>"I don't know about that," answered the girl.</p>
<br />
<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h2>THE BIG BEAR</h2>
<br />

<p>Dave was very thoughtful as the four boys
rowed back to the bungalows with the things procured
from Mr. Appleby. His talk with Della
Ford and her aunt had lasted until the others were
ready to depart, but he had gained little information
beyond that already known to the reader.</p>

<p>"If only I had the address of that Obadiah
Jones, I might go and see him and listen to what he
has to say about Ward Porton," he told himself.
"Of course he may not be Porton's uncle at all&mdash;I
know lots of children taken from poorhouses and
orphan asylums who call the folks aunt and uncle.
But even if he isn't, he may be able to give me
some information that will put me on the right
track regarding this affair."</p>

<p>The morning was spent by those at the bungalows
in getting settled once more. The provisions
brought from the Appleby camp were divided between
the two places, and likewise the kitchen
utensils.</p>

<p>"I'd like to set some sort of a trap and catch
those burglars," declared Ben.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>"I don't see how you're going to do it," returned
our hero. "I doubt very much whether
they will show themselves in this vicinity again.
More than likely they are miles away."</p>

<p>"Dave, do you think Link Merwell had anything
to do with this?"</p>

<p>"It's possible, Ben, although I don't see how he
would have the nerve to come back here after what
happened. I should think he would feel like quitting
this territory entirely."</p>

<p>Another day went by, bringing no word from
Crumville. Our hero and Roger had tramped all
the way to Carpen Falls, hoping for letters, but
the only one to come in was a re-directed epistle
for Ben, inviting him to become a subscriber to
some local charity.</p>

<p>"O shucks! I suppose the charity is all right,"
said Ben, when he got this letter, "but I'd like to
get some real news from dad or somebody else at
home."</p>

<p>Dave said little, but he felt more downcast than
ever. He had thought that a letter would surely
come by now. Roger noticed how he felt, and
placed a kindly hand on our hero's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry, Dave, old man," he said
feelingly, "this will come out all right in the
end."</p>

<p>"I hope so, Roger," was the answer. "But
this suspense wears on a fellow."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>"Perhaps if you went to Maine to that town
where the poorhouse is located that Ward Porton
says he came from, you might be able to find out
something about that Obadiah Jones," went on the
senator's son, who had been told of what the
Fords had revealed.</p>

<p>"I was thinking something of that, Roger, and
if I can't get on the track any other way, I'll go
there," was the reply. "But I hate to think of
leaving here until I get some kind of word from
Crumville."</p>

<p>"Well, some things move slowly, Dave, don't
forget that. More than likely your unc&mdash;I
mean the folks down in Crumville&mdash;are doing all
they can to get to the bottom of the matter.
Most likely they are investigating the proofs that
Ward Porton said he was willing to present."</p>

<p>On the following morning there was something
of a surprise. About eleven o'clock, while some
of the lads were fishing, and Dave had Jessie out
in a canoe, there came a shout from up the brook,
and looking in that direction our hero saw Phil
approaching, with his uncle beside him, leaning on
the youth's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Lawrence's ankle must have got
better quickly!" cried Dave.</p>

<p>"And is that the so-called wild man?" returned
Jessie. "He doesn't seem to be very wild now."</p>

<p>"You've heard us tell why he acted in that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>outlandish
way," was the answer, as Dave paddled
toward the dock.</p>

<p>Soon the boys were surrounding the new arrivals,
and Mr. Lawrence was led to a couch, upon
which he was glad to sit down and thus rest his
injured ankle. The ladies and the girls were introduced,
and the man shook hands with them
rather shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"I'll have to apologize to you for acting so
rudely," said Lester Lawrence, after the introductions
were over. "I suppose the boys have
told you why I did it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Lawrence," answered Mrs. Wadsworth,
kindly. "And under the circumstances we
are quite willing to let bygones be bygones."</p>

<p>"Can we do anything for your ankle?" questioned
Laura, who was a natural-born nurse.</p>

<p>"I guess about all it needs is rest," answered
Lester Lawrence. "It was quite a journey from
my shack to this place. But I saw that Phil was
getting anxious to rejoin you, so I told him we
might as well make the venture to-day rather than
wait. He has been hoping that you would have
some word for him from my brother."</p>

<p>"No word yet, Phil," answered Dave, "but
there may be in the mail to-day."</p>

<p>"Say, we had some scare this morning just before
we left the cabin!" declared the shipowner's
son. "I was nearly frightened into a fit!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>"What was that?" came from several of the
others.</p>

<p>"I was cleaning the dishes after breakfast, and
I went outdoors to throw some scraps in a heap
behind some bushes. Just as I got there with my
panful of stuff, up jumped&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;a
great big bear!"</p>

<p>"A bear!" shrieked the girls.</p>

<p>"Did you shoot him?" broke in Shadow.</p>

<p>"Shoot him? What with&mdash;a frying-pan?"</p>

<p>"Then the bear got away?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether the bear got away or I
got away. I dropped that frying-pan, and I
legged it for the cabin for all I was worth. In the
meantime the bear disappeared among the trees
just back of the cabin. I got my uncle's rifle and
went out to look for him, but it was no use."</p>

<p>"O dear, a bear!" murmured Jessie. "Suppose
he comes down here?" and she gave a slight
shiver.</p>

<p>"Why, that would be fun!" declared Belle.
"I'd like to see that bear, and get a shot at him,
too," went on the girl from Star Ranch.</p>

<p>"If that bear is anywhere in this vicinity we
might organize a hunt for him," suggested Luke,
who, on the day previous, had gone out with Ben
and Shadow and brought down a partridge.</p>

<p>"That's the talk!" cried Roger. "Come on,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>let us go on a hunt! It will give us something to
do."</p>

<p>The matter was discussed for a quarter of an
hour, and during that time Roger and Ben managed
to take Phil to one side and tell him about the
news from Crumville. The shipowner's son was,
of course, much astonished.</p>

<p>"I believe it's a fake!" he declared, flatly.
"Dave is Dave Porter, and no mistake! We
cleared that matter up directly after our return
from the South Seas."</p>

<p>"Just what I said, Phil," responded Roger.
"At the same time, I suppose the Porters have got
to listen to Ward Porton's claim."</p>

<p>"Bah! it's a conspiracy I tell you&mdash;a conspiracy
gotten up by this fellow, Porton, and by Link
Merwell! You can't tell me any different!" and
Phil's face showed his earnestness.</p>

<p>It was decided that all of the boys should go out
directly after lunch, in a hunt for the bear. The
number of shotguns and rifles on hand was enough
to go around, so that each of them would be
armed. They also provided themselves with
some provisions, not knowing how late it would
be before they got back.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, do be careful!" pleaded Jessie,
when the boys were ready to depart. "Don't let
that bear eat you up!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>"Don't worry," he answered. "I'll take care
of myself." And then he added with something
of a sigh: "I hope you have good news for me
when I get back."</p>

<p>"I hope so too, Dave. But just remember
what I said," she went on, looking him straight in
the eyes. "I'll think just as much of you even if
they prove that you are not Dave Porter."</p>

<p>Phil was with the crowd, and all headed up the
brook, and then along the trail leading to the cabin
which had been occupied by Lester Lawrence.
Arriving there, a hunt was made through the
forest back of the cabin.</p>

<p>"It's a good deal like hunting for the proverbial
needle in a haystack," remarked Roger.</p>

<p>"Where did you see the bear last, Phil?" questioned
Luke.</p>

<p>"Just about here," was the reply, and the shipowner's
son pointed with his hand. "I think he
went in that direction," he added.</p>

<p>The boys spread out in a long, straight line, and
in this fashion proceeded through the forest for
the best part of a mile. During that time they
thought they saw a deer in the distance, and Roger
might have taken a shot, but Dave imperatively
stopped him.</p>

<p>"We can't shoot at anything if we want to get
close to that bear," announced our hero. "Bears
are very scary creatures, and if you make too much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>noise that beast will run for miles and miles before
he stops."</p>

<p>Late afternoon found the boys still on the
search. They had seen nothing to shoot at, and
some of them were growing disheartened. Luke
was limping slightly, having caught his foot between
a crevice in the rocks.</p>

<p>"I move we rest and have something to eat,"
announced Ben, and this suggestion was quickly
seconded by the others. Then, when the sun was
well down in the west, they decided to turn back
toward the bungalows.</p>

<p>It was a tramp of over a mile and a half, and as
the footing in many places was uncertain, they had
to proceed with great care.</p>

<p>"Such a hunt!" grumbled Ben. "It's been all
hunting and no shooting."</p>

<p>"Which puts me in mind of a story!" cried
Shadow. "Oh, this is a short one, so you needn't
frown at it," he went on quickly, glancing around.
"It's about a fellow who came along and saw an
old man fishing in a lake. 'How's fishing?' he
asked of the old man. 'Couldn't be better,' was
the answer. 'Catch anything?' 'No.' 'Then
what do you mean by saying the fishing is good?'
'So it is. I didn't say anything about the catching.'"
And at this a grin went around.</p>

<p>"We ought to be getting in sight of the bungalows
soon," remarked Roger, after they had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>climbed over some rough rocks and were walking
through a dense patch of the forest.</p>

<p>"Say, this is a fine place to get lost in," remarked
Phil.</p>

<p>"It will be all right as long as the sunlight
lasts," answered Dave. "I am using that for a
compass."</p>

<p>Soon they came to the edge of a clearing, on the
other side of which were a series of rocks with
vines and brushwood. The boys were about to
advance across the clearing when suddenly
Shadow's arms went up into the air.</p>

<p>"St&mdash;st&mdash;stop!" he spluttered, in a low tone.
"Dr&mdash;dr&mdash;drop down, all of you!"</p>

<p>The others saw that he was much in earnest, and
immediately sank down behind the trees and rocks.
Then all gazed inquiringly at the former story-teller
of Oak Hall.</p>

<p>"It's the be&mdash;be&mdash;bear!" spluttered
Shadow. "Sa&mdash;say, don't you think we had
be&mdash;be&mdash;better run for it?"</p>

<p>"The bear! Where is it?" demanded Dave.</p>

<p>"I saw him just lift his head up among the rocks
yonder," returned Shadow. "Say, he looked like
an awful big fellow!"</p>

<p>"Well, if he is there, you bet we are not going
to run away from him!" declared Phil. "Come
on, let's see if we can't shoot him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>"Wait a minute, Phil," advised Dave. "If
the bear is among yonder rocks, as Shadow says,
we had better spread out a little, and thus get a better
chance at him."</p>

<p>Seeing that his companions were not frightened,
Shadow regained some of his composure and followed
them, although keeping a little to the rear.
With great caution, and holding their firearms
ready for use, the whole crowd of boys crossed the
clearing and gained the first of the rocks beyond.
Fortunately, the breeze was coming from ahead of
them, thus carrying their scent away from where
the bear was supposed to be.</p>

<p>It had been agreed that when necessary Dave
should give the signal to fire. He was slightly in
advance, and now with great caution he looked
over some rocks just ahead of him. The sight
that met his gaze was an interesting one. There
was a slight depression there, partly filled with
brushwood, and in the midst of this stood a big
bear. He had his head down in a hole, and was
digging out various things with his forepaws, flinging
them to one side and behind him. Out came a
kettle, a frying-pan, some knives and forks, cups,
saucers, a pie-plate, a dishpan, and numerous other
articles, which clattered over the rocks.</p>

<p>"Great hambones, Dave! what kind of a noise
is that?" asked Phil, who was beside our hero.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>"It's our stolen stuff, that's what it is, Phil!"
cried Dave. "Those burglars must have thrown
the stuff in that hole!"</p>

<p>"But what would the bear be doing among that
stuff?" questioned Luke.</p>

<p>"He's after grub," answered our hero.
"They must have thrown some of the food in
there with the other stuff. Come on, boys, get
ready to fire!"</p>

<p>Fortunately for the lads, the bear was so interested
in what he was trying to accomplish that he
did not notice their approach. The noise of the
flying kettles and pans drowned out the voices.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with all taking a shot at
him at the same time?" questioned Phil.</p>

<p>"All right, I'm willing," responded Dave,
quickly. "We might as well all have the glory
of killing him&mdash;if we have that luck."</p>

<p>Every rifle and every shotgun was quickly raised
and aimed at the bear. Just as Dave was on the
point of giving the order to fire, the beast came out
of the hole and looked around. Then in alarm he
raised up on his hind legs, a truly terrifying animal
to behold.</p>

<p>Bang! Crack! Bang! went the rifles and
shotguns in an irregular volley. And then, as the
report died away, the huge beast gave a leap
into the air, and coming down, sprang directly toward
the boys.</p>
<br />

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>

<h2>GOOD NEWS&mdash;CONCLUSION</h2>
<br />

<p>"Here he comes!"</p>

<p>"Give him another shot, boys!"</p>

<p>Crack! Bang! Crack! Again the shotguns
and rifles rang out.</p>

<p>Whether the shots were absolutely necessary or
not it would be hard to say, for just as the boys
discharged their various weapons the huge bear
was seen to stumble and fall. He gave several
convulsive shudders, and then lay still.</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;is he de&mdash;dead?" gasped Shadow,
who was still a few feet in the rear of the others.</p>

<p>"I think he is," responded Dave. "Load up
again as quickly as you can and we'll watch him,"
and then he proceeded to take care of his own firearm.</p>

<p>But watching was unnecessary, for the huge
beast had breathed his last. It was a proud crowd
of boys that surrounded the game.</p>

<p>"Say, that's some shooting!" declared Phil,
his eyes glistening. "Won't the others be surprised
when they hear of it?"</p>

<p>"He certainly is a big one!" said Ben. "I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>don't believe they grow them much bigger than
that anywhere around here." And this assertion
proved true, as the boys learned when, later on,
Tad Rason saw the game at the bungalows.</p>

<p>"Well, we've got our kitchen utensils and most
of the tableware back, anyway," declared Roger,
after an inspection of the hollow where they had
first discovered the bear at work. "Hello, here's
the stuff Mr. Bruin was after!" he added, holding
up a chunk of meat which still lay in a pan in the
hollow. This meat had been taken from the
Wadsworth ice-box; but why it had been placed in
the hollow was a mystery.</p>

<p>"But it's a good thing the burglars put it
there," declared Luke. "That is what attracted
the bear and made him dig."</p>

<p>A careful search of the hollow revealed nearly
everything that had been taken from the two
bungalows except Laura's rings and Mrs. Basswood's
silverware.</p>

<p>"I guess they thought those things too valuable
to leave here," was Dave's comment. "I am convinced
of one thing," he added.</p>

<p>"What is that?" questioned Ben.</p>

<p>"I believe Link Merwell is at the bottom of
this. No ordinary burglar would bother his head
about that kitchen stuff. Merwell did it, just to
cause us trouble. Maybe he thought we'd have to
give up camping here for the time being."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>"By Jove, Dave, I think you have solved it!"
declared Roger.</p>

<p>"All of which doesn't give my mother her silverware
nor Laura her rings," returned Ben.</p>

<p>A sapling with some stout branches attached
was cut down, and on to this the boys rolled the
bear and tied him fast. Thus they managed, after
a good deal of hard labor, to haul the carcass down
to the bungalows.</p>

<p>"Oh, here they come, and they've got a bear!"
shrieked Belle, who saw them first, and all the
inmates of the bungalows hurried to the scene,
even Mr. Lawrence hobbling up with the aid of a
cane.</p>

<p>"Yes, we got a bear, and we got more than
that!" cried Ben, excitedly. "We've found all
the kitchen stuff!" and he and the other youths
gave the particulars.</p>

<p>A little later some of the boys returned to the
hollow and transferred the stolen stuff back to the
bungalows. A good deal of the canned provisions
was still in perfect condition. The other things,
including the meat the bear had scented, were
thrown away.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave!" cried Jessie, as soon as she could
motion our hero to one side, "I've got something
I want to tell you! I think maybe it will be of assistance
in proving your identity," and the girl's
eyes glowed with anticipation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>"What is it, Jessie?" he asked, quickly.
"Have you heard something from home?"</p>

<p>"No, but I've heard something from Mr. Lawrence,
Phil's uncle. Isn't it the strangest thing
ever! I was talking to him after you left, and
told him what trouble you were having, and mentioned
Ward Porton and that man the Fords told
you about, Obadiah Jones. And, would you believe
it! years ago Mr. Lawrence had some business
dealings with a man named Obadiah Jones,
and he is quite sure that man had a nephew who
was named Ward!"</p>

<p>"Jessie! can this be true?" exclaimed Dave,
with pardonable excitement.</p>

<p>"That's what Mr. Lawrence told me. I think
you had better speak to him, and without delay."</p>

<p>"I certainly will!" declared our hero, and going
up to the crowd that was still around the bear,
he touched Phil's uncle on the arm.</p>

<p>"What is it, Porter? Oh! I suppose you
want to see me about that man, Obadiah Jones.
Well, I'll tell you all I know. Come on back to
where I can sit down. This lame ankle of mine
is still rather weak." And thus speaking Mr.
Lawrence led the way around to the front porch
of the bungalow.</p>

<p>"What I want to know is if this Ward Porton
was really a nephew of Obadiah Jones," said Dave.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what Miss Jessie wanted to know,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>too. Of course I don't know for sure, but I do
know the boy's name was Ward and that he called
Jones, Uncle Obadiah. You might write to Obadiah
Jones and find out. He lives in Burlington,
Vermont, and that's not so very far from here&mdash;just
on the other side of Lake Champlain. His
full name is Obadiah L. L. Jones. We used to always
call him Old L. L. About everybody in
Burlington knows him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'd better go and call on Mr. Jones,"
suggested Dave. "I'd hate to wait for an answer
to a letter."</p>

<p>It was not long before the others in the camp
knew what Dave had learned concerning Ward
Porton and his supposed uncle, Obadiah L. L.
Jones. The boys agreed with Dave that it might
pay to make a trip to Burlington to see him, and
Phil and Roger volunteered to go along.</p>

<p>"You might want a witness or two," declared
the senator's son.</p>

<p>The upshot of the matter was that the following
day found the three boys bound for Burlington.
The other lads helped to row them to the
upper end of the lake, and there, at a camp belonging
to a rich New Yorker, they managed to obtain
a horse and buckboard on which they rode to
the nearest railroad station. They were in time to
catch the midday train for Plattsburg, where they
had to remain over night. Then they caught the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>first boat across Lake Champlain to the city for
which they were bound.</p>

<p>Dave had been told by Mr. Lawrence where
they might find Obadiah Jones, who was interested
in a coal, lumber, and real estate business. Our
hero, accompanied by his two chums, found the
man in his office, a small, dingy coop of a place surrounded
by huge piles of lumber. He was a short,
stout, bald-headed individual, wearing large spectacles,
and he looked up rather uninvitingly as they
entered.</p>

<p>"Is this Mr. Obadiah Jones?" questioned
Dave, politely.</p>

<p>"That's my name, young man. What can I do
for you?" demanded the lumber dealer, brusquely.</p>

<p>"I came to get a little information from you,
Mr. Jones, if you'll give it to me," went on our
hero. "My name is Dave Porter. I came to see
if you have a nephew named Ward Porton."</p>

<p>"Well, I did have a nephew by that name, but
he's a nephew of mine no longer!" cried Obadiah
Jones, his face showing sudden anger. "If you
came here in his behalf, the sooner you get out the
better! I wrote to him and told him I never
wanted to see him nor hear from him again!"</p>

<p>"I didn't come in his behalf, Mr. Jones. I
came on my own account," answered Dave. "All
I want to know is: Is he a real nephew of yours
or not?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>"Yes, he's my real nephew&mdash;the son of my
youngest sister, who married a good-for-nothing
army man. But that doesn't make any difference
to me, young man. I won't do a thing more for
him, nephew though he is. He's a young scamp,
and as I said before, I never want to see him nor
hear from him again."</p>

<p>"The reason I ask is, because there has come
up a question regarding Ward Porton's identity,"
continued Dave, who could scarcely conceal his
satisfaction over the turn the conversation had
taken. "Porton declared to me that he had been
brought up in a Maine poorhouse."</p>

<p>"That's all tommy-rot, young man! It isn't so
at all!" stormed Obadiah Jones. "After his
father ran away, to join some revolutionists in
Mexico, his mother was hard put to it to support
herself, and when she took sick and died, he was
placed in the Lumberville poorhouse by some
neighbors. As soon as I heard of it I sent for him
to come to Montpelier, where I was then doing
business. After that I brought him here. I gave
him a good education and did everything I could
to set him on his feet, but he began to smoke and
drink and gamble, and get into bad company generally,
and finally he left here and went on the
stage as an actor. I heard he didn't do very well
at that business, and so he got into the moving-picture
business." Obadiah Jones looked sharply
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>at Dave. "But what do you want to know all this
for?" he questioned, quickly.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you why, Mr. Jones," answered Dave.
And without waiting to be invited he sat down on
a chair beside the lumber dealer and told the man
the particulars of the trouble Ward Porton had
caused him.</p>

<p>"Humph!" snorted Obadiah Jones at the conclusion
of the recital. "That sounds just like one
of Ward's fairy tales. Don't you take any stock
in that story, because there is absolutely nothing in
it. I have disowned him, it is true, but, nevertheless,
he is my nephew, the son of my youngest
sister, Clarice Jones Porton. Her good-for-nothing
husband was Lieutenant Jarvey Porton of the
army, who was discharged because of irregularities
in his accounts. I never wanted her to marry
the lieutenant, but she wouldn't listen to me for a
minute."</p>

<p>After this a conversation lasting the best part of
half an hour ensued. The lumber dealer became
quite interested in Dave's case, and readily consented
to sign a document stating the facts concerning
Ward Porton as he knew them. Roger,
Phil and an office clerk witnessed the lumber
dealer's signature, and then the boys bade Obadiah
Jones good-bye and left.</p>

<p>"Dave, let me congratulate you!" cried Roger,
grasping our hero's hand warmly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>"Oh, I knew it would all come out right in the
end!" cried Phil, as he placed a loving arm over
Dave's shoulder. "Say, you'll have one on Ward
Porton when you show him that document!" he
continued, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"You don't know what a weight this has lifted
from my shoulders," murmured Dave. And despite
his efforts to control himself, two tears stood
in his eyes. "The thought that I might not be the
real Dave Porter after all was something terrible!"
he murmured.</p>

<p>"What will you do; send word to Crumville and
then go back to camp?" asked Roger.</p>

<p>"I suppose that would be best," answered
Dave. "I'll first send word home and wait in
Burlington for a reply."</p>

<p>It was not long after this when they entered a
local telegraph office, and there Dave wrote out a
telegram addressed to his father at Crumville.
He asked that a reply to the communication be addressed
to a leading hotel of Burlington, where the
three lads afterwards went for dinner.</p>

<p>"A telegram for Mr. David Porter!" called
out one of the hotel boys, just after the lads had
finished eating; and he passed the communication
over to our hero.</p>

<p>"It's from Crumville, and from my father,"
said Dave, as he glanced at the communication,
which ran as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>"Your telegram received. Glad to know the
truth. We had suspected Porton of trickery.
Merwell is in the game."</p>

<p>"It's just as I thought," said Dave, when he allowed
his friends to read the communication.
"Link Merwell told Porton about how I had come
from the poorhouse, and then the pair hatched up
this game between them. I only hope my folks
catch them and give them what they deserve."</p>

<p>That afternoon found the lads again on the
way to Plattsburg, and early on the following
morning they set out on the return to Bear Camp.</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave! did you learn anything?" cried
Laura, when the boys appeared.</p>

<p>"Yes, Laura, it's all cleared up!" he exclaimed,
in a voice filled with joy. "Ward Porton is
nothing but a faker. He is the real nephew of
Obadiah Jones, and the son of Jones's youngest
sister. I've got a document in my pocket to prove
it."</p>

<p>"Oh, Dave, I'm so glad! so glad!" was the
cry of the sister, and she threw herself into his
arms and kissed him several times. Then Jessie
came up and kissed him too, and so did Belle,
followed by Mrs. Basswood, and finally Mrs.
Wadsworth, who held him closely to her.</p>

<p>"I'm very, very glad for your sake, Dave,"
said the wife of the jewelry manufacturer. "But
if you hadn't proved to be Dave Porter, I should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>have been only too glad to have adopted you as my
son."</p>

<p>It was certainly a happy return, and that evening
both bungalows were lit up brightly in honor
of the occasion. Shadow was allowed to tell some
of his best stories, Luke played on his banjo and
his guitar, and the young folks sang one familiar
song after another.</p>

<p>Three days, including Sunday, passed, and then
came another surprise. Late in the evening Dave
heard a well-known whistle on the trail leading to
Carpen Falls, and a little later one of the old stage
coaches came into view. All in the bungalows ran
out to meet the newcomers, who proved to be
Dave's father, his uncle, Mr. Wadsworth, and Mr.
Basswood.</p>

<p>"Dad!" yelled Dave, and rushing to his parent
he caught him tightly in his arms.</p>

<p>"My boy! my boy!" murmured Mr. Porter.
"How very glad I am that this black cloud has
passed away. But, Dave, don't think that I believed
that story. I thought it was a fake from
the start."</p>

<p>"And so did I," said Dunston Porter.
"There couldn't be any Dave Porter but you!"
and he gave Dave a good-natured thump between
the shoulders that nearly knocked the wind out of
the youth.</p>

<p>"We've got more news," declared Mr. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>Wadsworth,
as he, too, came up for a handshake, followed
by Ben's father. "They have collared
Link Merwell at last."</p>

<p>"Is that so!" cried our hero.</p>

<p>"Yes, they caught him in a pawnbroker's shop,"
said Mr. Basswood. "And the best part of it is
that they caught him trying to pawn my wife's
silver spoons and Laura's two rings. The pawnbroker
got suspicious, and as he happened to be an
honest man, he called in a detective. This detective
remembered the picture he had seen printed
of Link at the time he and Jasniff stole the jewelry,
and he at once placed Link under arrest."</p>

<p>"And then I went to see Link in prison," broke
in Dave's father. "I had a long talk with him,
about the burglary up here, and he admitted that
he had thrown all that other stuff in the hollow
just to inconvenience you. Then I made him confess
that he and Ward Porton had concocted this
scheme concerning Porton's identity between them.
Merwell tried to bribe me by saying he wouldn't
tell the truth about Porton unless I aided him to
get clear of the charge made against him by Mr.
Wadsworth. Of course I wouldn't agree to do
that."</p>

<p>"It won't be necessary to have Link Merwell
testify against Porton," declared Dave. "I've
got a document here that shows up Porton for just
what he is;" and later on he allowed his father
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>and the others to read the paper which he had had
Obadiah L. L. Jones sign.</p>

<p>"Oh, to think I'm to have my rings back, and
Mrs. Basswood is to have her silverware!" cried
Laura, with satisfaction. "Isn't it perfectly
lovely?"</p>

<p>The days to follow at Bear Camp were happy
ones indeed. The boys went hunting and fishing
to their hearts' content, and often took the girls
out in the boats or in the canoes. In the meanwhile
some of the men folks returned to Crumville,
and Phil took his uncle home.</p>

<p>It may be stated here that Phil's father and
mother were filled with joy to have Lester Lawrence
once more with them, and later on the land
that the rival railroads wanted was sold to one of
the roads for an even sixty thousand dollars,
three-quarters of which amount went to Phil's
father and the other quarter to the boy's uncle.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Ward Porton will ever bother
you again, Dave," said Roger, one day, but the
surmise of the senator's son proved incorrect.
When Ward Porton learned that our hero had
visited Obadiah Jones he lost no time in disappearing
for awhile. But then he got back to his
old tricks, and what he did will be related in
another volume, to be entitled, "Dave Porter and
His Double; Or, The Disappearance of the Basswood
Fortune."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>When Link Merwell was brought to trial, his
father came forward and did everything he could
for the wayward son. But it was proved beyond a
doubt that Merwell had been as guilty as Jasniff,
and he received an equal sentence of imprisonment.</p>

<p>"Poor Link! I feel sorry for him," was
Dave's comment. "He might have made quite a
man of himself."</p>

<p>The weather was now growing colder every day,
and soon there was a trace of snow in the air.</p>

<p>"We'll have to leave Bear Camp very soon unless
we want to be snowed in," declared Mrs.
Wadsworth. And then after a conference, it was
decided by all hands to pack up and go home.</p>

<p>"Well, in spite of our troubles, it's been a grand
outing!" declared Roger.</p>

<p>"One of the best ever!" added Phil.</p>

<p>"I've had a perfectly lovely time!" came from
Jessie. "But I do hope Dave never again runs
into such trouble as he had up here."</p>

<p>"Well, a fellow has got to take things as they
come," answered our hero.</p>

<p>And here, with the future looking cloudless and
bright, we will leave Dave Porter and say good-bye.</p>
